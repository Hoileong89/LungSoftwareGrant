	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To adapt the so-called nonlocal means filter to deal with magnetic resonance (MR) images with spatially varying noise levels (for both Gaussian and Rician distributed noise).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Most filtering techniques assume an equal noise distribution across the image. When this assumption is not met, the resulting filtering becomes suboptimal. This is the case of MR images with spatially varying noise levels, such as those obtained by parallel imaging (sensitivity-encoded), intensity inhomogeneity-corrected images, or surface coil-based acquisitions. We propose a new method where information regarding the local image noise level is used to adjust the amount of denoising strength of the filter. Such information is automatically obtained from the images using a new local noise estimation method.
RESULTS: The proposed method was validated and compared with the standard nonlocal means filter on simulated and real MRI data showing an improved performance in all cases.
CONCLUSION: The new noise-adaptive method was demonstrated to outperform the standard filter when spatially varying noise is present in the images.},

@article{Tustison:2016aa,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose an accurate methodological framework for automatically segmenting pulmonary proton MRI based on an optimal consensus of a spatially normalized library of annotated lung atlases.
METHODS: A library of 62 manually annotated lung atlases comprising 48 mixed healthy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthmatic subjects of a large age range with multiple ventilation levels is used to produce an optimal segmentation in proton MRI, based on a consensus of the spatially normalized library. An extension of this methodology is used to provide best-guess estimates of lobar subdivisions in proton MRI from annotated computed tomography data.
RESULTS: A leave-one-out evaluation strategy was used for evaluation. Jaccard overlap measures for the left and right lungs were used for performance comparisons relative to the current state-of-the-art (0.966 $\pm$ 0.018 and 0.970 $\pm$ 0.016, respectively). Best-guess estimates for the lobes exhibited comparable performance levels (left upper: 0.882 $\pm$ 0.059, left lower: 0.868 $\pm$ 0.06, right upper: 0.852 $\pm$ 0.067, right middle: 0.657 $\pm$ 0.130, right lower: 0.873 $\pm$ 0.063).
CONCLUSION: An annotated atlas library approach can be used to provide good lung and lobe estimation in proton MRI. The proposed framework is useful for subsequent anatomically based analysis of structural and/or functional pulmonary image data.

@article{Wang:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Label fusion based multi-atlas segmentation has proven to be one of the most competitive techniques for medical image segmentation. This technique transfers segmentations from expert-labeled images, called atlases, to a novel image using deformable image registration. Errors produced by label transfer are further reduced by label fusion that combines the results produced by all atlases into a consensus solution. Among the proposed label fusion strategies, weighted voting with spatially varying weight distributions derived from atlas-target intensity similarity is a simple and highly effective label fusion technique. However, one limitation of most weighted voting methods is that the weights are computed independently for each atlas, without taking into account the fact that different atlases may produce similar label errors. To address this problem, we recently developed the joint label fusion technique and the corrective learning technique, which won the first place of the 2012 MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Challenge and was one of the top performers in 2013 MICCAI Segmentation: Algorithms, Theory and Applications (SATA) challenge. To make our techniques more accessible to the scientific research community, we describe an Insight-Toolkit based open source implementation of our label fusion methods. Our implementation extends our methods to work with multi-modality imaging data and is more suitable for segmentation problems with multiple labels. We demonstrate the usage of our tools through applying them to the 2012 MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Challenge brain image dataset and the 2013 SATA challenge canine leg image dataset. We report the best results on these two datasets so far.},

@article{Avants:2010aa,
	Abstract = {We evaluate the impact of template choice on template-based segmentation of the hippocampus in epilepsy. Four dataset-specific strategies are quantitatively contrasted: the "closest to average" individual template, the average shape version of the closest to average template, a best appearance template and the best appearance and shape template proposed here and implemented in the open source toolkit Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS). The cross-correlation similarity metric drives the correspondence model and is used consistently to determine the optimal appearance. Minimum shape distance in the diffeomorphic space determines optimal shape. Our evaluation results show that, with respect to gold-standard manual labeling of hippocampi in epilepsy, optimal shape and appearance template construction outperforms the other strategies for gaining data-derived templates. Our results also show the improvement is most significant on the diseased side and insignificant on the healthy side. Thus, the importance of the template increases when used to study pathology and may be less critical for normal control studies. Furthermore, explicit geometric optimization of the shape component of the unbiased template positively impacts the study of diseased hippocampi.},
