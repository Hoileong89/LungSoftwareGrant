### 3(c.3) __Specific Aim 2.__  Validate and disseminate the developed ITK-Lung resources by leveraging use cases from a broad network of partner investigators representing the state-of-the-science in lung imaging research
This aim builds on the project teamâ€™s long and successful track record of collaboration with the general
user community.  In particular, the investigator-driven studies presented below are carefully selected
both for their capacity to fully exercise the developed tools and to provide a comprehensive representation
of the various processing and analysis tasks of interest to the community.
\textcolor{black}{Two evaluation groups will serve as primary and secondary beta testers, respectively:
institutional and external collaborators.  For the former, the development team will be embedded in
the labs of project co-investigators, providing training to lab personnel and assisting with the
creation of customized analysis pipelines.  These experiences will be used to develop tutorial
materials and processing examples that our external collaborators will independently test by
processing their own data in-house with beta versions of the proposed software and data resources.
Similarly, the dissemination and user support mechanisms outlined in the Resource Sharing Plan will
be refined by employing these as much as possible to communicate and interact with the external
collaborator group.}

__3(c.3.1) Novel imaging biomarkers for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).__
Co-investigator __Mike Shim__ and his group have been actively developing 3D hyperpolarized
xenon-129 dissolved-phase MRI (HXe MRI) as a sensitive biomarker for accurately characterizing
phenotypes and severity of COPD. This protocol permits regional mapping of ventilation and
gas uptake by tissue and blood in human lungs with single breath hold
[@Dregely:2011aa;@Mugler:2010aa;@Qing:2014ab].  This project plans to establish connectivity
between these advanced HXe MRI imaging signatures and important clinical outcomes of COPD to
advance HXe MRI as a novel clinical diagnostic tool. This new biomarker
tool will naturally lead to deeper mechanistic understanding of COPD at the molecular-physiologic
and clinical levels and support identification of potential pathophysiologic derangement
associated with COPD and a new method to accurately predict therapeutic response to current
standard COPD therapies. Refinement of HXe MRI as a pulmonary diagnostic tool is anticipated
to encourage development of new clinical interventions.

HXe MRI is the
first non-invasive imaging technique that can provide regional information about three unique
characteristics of lung function: lung ventilation, size and connectedness of distal alveolar
airspaces, and HXe gas transfer from airspaces to red blood cells. HXe MRI, therefore, is
anticipated to overcome the limitation
of pulmonary function testing (PFT) which only provides physiologic parameters of the lung
as a whole unit, and High Resolution CT (HRCT) which only provides anatomic characterization
without physiologic information.
HXe MRI has potential to detect pathologic changes present in COPD patients with
high sensitivity and specificity previously unattainable by the current clinical standard
(PFT and HRCT). Moreover, HXe MRI can determine whether gas transfer
abnormalities are due to impaired ventilation or reduced gas-exchange, and thus provide new
insights into the pathogenesis of COPD in individual patients.

Crucial to the success of establishing the utility of HXe MRI as a sensitive biomarker
for accurately characterizing COPD phenotypes is quantification of imaging signatures in
an automated and robust fashion.  Identification of ventilation dead space ($V_D$)
for correlation with GOLD classification will utilize the
ventilation-based segmentation functionality in ITK-Lung [@Tustison:2011aa].
In order to determine lobar
values of HXe MRI, this study will utilize the recently proposed lobar estimation algorithm
[@Tustison:2016aa] that will be available for both proton MRI and CT.


__3(c.3.2) Hyperpolarized gas imaging in children with asthma.__
Advances in rapid image sequencing methods have facilitated the acquisition of high-quality
hyperpolarized gas MR images in pre-school children [@Altes:2006aa]. Furthermore, improvements in image
processing and signal intensity analysis have made possible accurate measurements of
lung volume compartments [@Tustison:2011aa].
Co-investigators __Gerry Teague__ and __Talissa Altes__
are applying these innovations in children with asthma to study whether the lung
defect volume % as measured by hyperpolarized lung MRI correlates with a range of clinical
features. They hypothesize the ventilation defect volume % would be higher in children with
severe asthma, and correlate not only with the degree of airflow limitation, but indicators
of asthma control, treatment, and inflammation.

Precise measurement of ventilation volumes by hyperpolarized noble gas MRI not only has the
potential to resolve the spatial and temporal characteristics of gas distribution in
children with asthma, but could also expand clinically relevant information in regards to
asthma severity and its features.  In the past, simple computer-assisted systems [@Woodhouse:2005aa] or
hand counts of visual defects were used to estimate the ventilation defect volume [@Altes:2001aa].
Development of more advanced techniques (in terms of acquisition and analysis) will facilitate
rapid conversion of complex hyperpolarized gas signal data into volume compartments for
clinical applications.

Absolutely crucial to the advanced techniques being developed by Dr. Teague and his group
are sophisticated image analysis tools like the ones being proposed in this project.  For example,
our ventilation-based segmentation method is already being used to determine
volumetric compartments based on lung function.  Additional ``cleaning'' necessary for these
data include denoising techniques [@Manjon:2010aa] implemented and made available in ANTs.
Lobe estimation will be possible by refining the techniques originally described in
[@Tustison:2016aa].

__3(c.3.3) Characterization of COPDGene cohort by hyperpolarized gas (HP) MRI.__
Co-investigator __Rahim Rizi__ is leading a study of lung function and
structure in COPD using HP MRI.
Once inhaled, this gas can tell the researcher how well specific lung
regions replace the air during the normal breathing cycle (Fractional
Ventilation, FV), how much oxygen is in the airspaces (Oxygen Tension,
PAO2), and if the normal spongy tissue structure has been compromised in
lung disease (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient). Subjects will include
those at risk for lung disease, and those displaying mild and moderate
COPD. They will be mostly drawn from the well-characterized
population currently enrolled in the COPDGene trial (10,000 subjects
overall) such that standard clinical images (End Inspiration and End
Expiration CT) and Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs), as well as genetic
sequencing, will already have been done. Each subject will be imaged
twice during the course of the five-year study, and regional
features will be compared between the CT and MRI images to the genetic
markers, changes in clinical measurements, and patient quality of life.

The proposed study will generate non-invasive biomarkers of COPD
progression derived from minute, short-term alterations in lung function
and microstructure. Due to the excellent safety profile of MRI, these
metrics will be appropriate for use in novel, flexible study designs.
Perhaps most importantly, this research will enhance understanding of
the natural history of COPD. In doing so, it will provide a vital
supplement to ongoing efforts to identify COPD subtypes by adding
substantial physiologic detail to descriptions of this disease. The
overall goals of the study experiments are:
a) to develop imaging markers that better identify early COPD;
b) to develop tests that predict health deterioration due to COPD;
c)	to determine if specific patterns of disease progression are associated with genetic markers identified in the larger COPDGene study; and
d)	to determine if disease progression is in part caused by excessive stretch in regions of the lung next to blocked-off areas unable to inflate normally.

More than 200 million people suffer from COPD worldwide. Yet effectively
assessing the progression of this increasingly prevalent disease and
monitoring its response to treatment remain problematic. Hyperpolarized
gas MRI can help rectify these issues by providing sensitive
measurements of lung physiology and microstructure, but its adoption by
clinicians and investigators has been slow. In contrast, CT-based
methods for measuring emphysema, airway wall thickening, and expiratory
air trapping have become common in COPD clinical studies. There are
several reasons for this: CT is more accessible, its images possess
excellent spatial resolution, and quantification of these images is
currently superior. However, most CT-based parameters have only an
indirect relation to physiology, and the modality exposes patients to
ionizing radiation. Both of these shortcomings can be addressed by HP
gas MRI. Consequently, the study seeks to more fully exploit the
clinical potential of HP gas MRI by optimizing and testing parameters
for the regional assessment of COPD patients and symptomatic smokers.

A novel multi-breath HP MRI technique allows for the simultaneous
measurement of fractional ventilation (FV), regional partial pressure of
oxygen (PAO2), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Obtaining all
three parameters in a single scan reduces the necessary amount of
imaging gas while increasing accuracy by correcting artifacts associated
with collateral ventilation and the slow filling of parenchyma in
diseased lungs. Each of these metrics allows for the investigation of a
vital aspect of lung disease progression and their comparison with the
current CT-based standard of care will help to more clearly
understand different features and phenotypes of COPD.

The proposed image analysis software will be central to the successful
conduct of the following tasks necessary to establish the goals of this
study:

*	Registration of the multibreath/multislice gas MRI images of the whole lung consisting of a minimum of seven time points
*	Registration and analysis of inspiratory and expiratory CT for airway changes to assess airway collapsibility and remodeling and other CT markers
*	Registration and analysis of inspiratory and expiratory CT with MRI to study the similarities and differences of the two modalities in phenotyping the COPD population
*	Registration of the follow-up MRI and CT images (two years) to determine if disease progression is in part caused by excessive stretch in regions of the lung next to blocked-off areas unable to inflate normally (based on the baseline MRI and CT)

__3(c.3.4) Advanced image analysis of CT for early diagnosis and prognosis of
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) in lung transplant patients.__
Co-investigators __Eduardo Barbosa__ and __Warren Gefter__ are conducting a
retrospective study of more than 300 lung transplant patients to advance
the early diagnosis of BOS. Lung transplantation is an established
treatment for end-stage, irreversible pulmonary disease, particularly
due to COPD and interstitial lung disease (ILD). While continued
improvements in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive medications
have reduced the complication rates and increased short-term survival
after the procedure, chronic allograft rejection due to bronchiolitis
obliterans (a fibrous obliterative disease of bronchioles representing
the histological hallmark of chronic rejection and resulting in
obstructive pulmonary physiology) remains the major cause of morbidity
and mortality after six months following transplantation. Bronchiolitis
obliterans currently represents the greatest limitation to long-term
survival after lung transplantation. While the diagnosis of
bronchiolitis obliterans is a pathologic one and therefore requires
invasive biopsy, the distribution of disease is patchy, with focal areas
of abnormality surrounded by normal lung, and consequently even biopsies
may fail to demonstrate the diagnosis. For these reasons, the
International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation has recommended
using declining spirometry, termed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome
(BOS), as a surrogate marker of chronic allograft rejection. In clinical
practice, the diagnosis of BOS is suspected based on an unexplained
decline in lung function (measured by PFT, of greater than 20% of
baseline FEV1) and worsening cough and dyspnea, in the absence of other
explanations such as pulmonary infection or congestive heart failure.
MDCT plays an important role by demonstrating low attenuation areas
representing air trapping, particularly on expiratory images, which
correlate with the presence of bronchiolitis obliterans. Prior studies
reported limited sensitivity for the early diagnosis of bronchiolitis
obliterans; however these utilized semi-quantitative or qualitative
assessment of air trapping in non-volumetric data sets. This study aims
to assess whether more advanced, fully automated imaging analysis can detect early BOS prior
to development of clinically apparent disease.

PFT is the current reference standard for diagnosis of BOS; however, by
the time PFT abnormalities beyond the threshold of BOS diagnosis ensue,
the disease is already manifest and is not reversible with existing
therapies. It is conceivable that sophisticated analysis of CT,
including quantitative attenuation masks in inspiratory and expiratory
datasets, image registration and texture based feature extraction [@Barbosa:2011aa;@Song:2012aa] may
allow earlier detection of BOS in the preclinical phase, potentially
generating surrogate biomarkers for drug trials and earlier
prognostication.

Application of the proposed advanced software tools and algorithms in
this project for quantitative analysis of CT images in lung
transplantation patients will be crucial to enable computation of an
array of first and second order statistics \textcolor{black}{that} would capture not only
attenuation maps but also regional deformation and texture based
features. In combination, this would allow multiparametric statistical
modeling that may predict which patients will develop BOS before PFT
abnormalities beyond the diagnostic threshold ensue. Such tools will be
extended to other diffuse lung diseases, potentially generating new
biomarkers for diagnosis, prognostication, and therapeutic trials.

__3(c.3.5) Novel PET/CT biomarkers for early prediction of treatment response and survival in patients
with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).__
PET and CT have traditionally played important roles in diagnosis, staging, and predicting
treatment response in NSCLC [@Lardinois:2003aa;@Lee:2010aa;@Horne:2014aa]. Although many studies have demonstrated diagnostic and
prognostic value of tumor metabolic burden and morphological information derived from PET/CT
imaging measures [@Horne:2014aa;@Kim:2012aa], current ability to predict treatment response and survival following
radiation therapy in NSCLC is far from satisfactory [@Berman:2014aa]. The poor performance of existing
methods may be due to a number of reasons: first, most studies have been limited to primary
tumor lesions and ignored the information available in other lesions/regions [@Ryu:2014aa]; second,
many investigations have focused on global image measures of tumors, such as those derived
from standardized uptake value (SUV) of PET images and tumor morphological information,
which may not be sufficient for capturing subtleties of tumor characteristics and tumor
heterogeneity [@Chicklore:2013aa;@Depeursinge:2014aa]; and finally, group-level statistical analysis strategies are typically
adopted to evaluate imaging markers, which may not be effective for personalized prediction [@Henderson:2005aa].

To improve prediction of radiation therapy treatment response and survival in patients with
NSCLC based on PET/CT imaging data, co-investigator __David Mankoff__ and collaborators are
developing methods to adaptively extract image features from the data that are then input
into a multi-task learning framework constructed to jointly model (and leverage potential
statistical correlations between) the problems of predicting treatment response and survival.
The proposed software tools will fulfill essential pre-processing needs of the study: PET/CT
data will be co-registered and a wealth of image features calculated using ITK-Lung.

manual registration for assessing lung CT bronchial morphologic changes and
hyperpolarized helium MR ventilation defects in asthma patients: Can
automation speed the work flow for combining structure and function

Our collaborators __Sean Fain__ and __Mark Schiebler__, __University of Wisconsin__,
are part of the SARP (Severe Asthma Research Program) team developing
imaging biomarkers of asthma severity for predicting asthma
exacerbation.  The approach of finding airway abnormalities that
correlate with ventilation defects is viable only with the availability
of robust image registration across the two modalities.  Furthermore,
translation to the clinic will require standardized implementations
across sites, and the projectâ€™s open-source platform is ideal for this
purpose.

__3(c.3.7) Validation of voxel-based ventilation CT.__ Our collaborator __Jim Wild__,
__University of Sheffield__, has been active in the field of methods development
for quantitative pulmonary imaging and its clinical translation for more than a decade.
Relevant to this project, his group requires advanced registration capabilities to
validate a novel CT technique for obtaining high-resolution images of pulmonary
ventilation. In addition, there is need within his research for multi-modality
registration of pulmonary CT and MRI images as well as segmentation of key lung
structures as part of standard processing workflows.

__3(c.3.8) Deep functional phenotyping of COPD.__  Our collaborator __Hans-Ulrich
Kauczor__, __University Medical Center Heidelberg__, is leading the COSYCONET
(German COPD and Systemic Consequences--Comorbidities Network) study,
the worldâ€™s first prospective multicenter trial comparing proton MRI and
CT imaging for characterizing COPD, with the latter modality serving as
the reference standard.  Automated image registration and segmentation
will play a vital role in defining the quantitative CT (air trapping,
airway collapsibility and remodeling, and pulmonary blood volume and
vascular pruning) and MR (air trapping, perfusion volume defects, and
hypoxic vasoconstriction) imaging biomarkers that form the basis for the
study.

__3(c.3.9) Longitudinal imaging follow-up in COPD and lung cancer.__  Our collaborator
__Joon-Beom Seo__, __Asan Medical Center__, directs the imaging component of the
Korean Obstructive Lung Disease (KOLD) cohort study, which has collected
over 1000 COPD cases from 17 participating centers with repeated imaging
since 2005.  He also leads a national lung cancer radiomics project that
has accrued 800 cases to date.  In both studies, robust image
registration is essential to tracking changes over time, and
segmentation is an additional requirement to support automated lesion
delineation for the cancer project.

__3(c.3.10) Advanced image processing pipelines for MR image-guided pulmonary
therapy decisions and support.__  Our collaborator __Grace Parraga__,
__University of Western Ontario__, has been at the forefront of MR imaging
of lung structure and function since 2005.  A major challenge hampering
widespread translation of current pulmonary imaging advances is the lack
of precision in their interpretation, thereby complicating the planning
and guiding of targeted therapies.  The projectâ€™s software tools will
enable the development of robust analysis pipelines for the translation
of in vivo imaging biomarkers in an open and consistent manner  across platforms and centers.  This
work, carried out in collaboration with industrial partners, will
support patient phenotyping and stratification to therapy as well as
measurement of longitudinal changes and response to therapy.

__3(c.3.11) Functional MR imaging of the lungs using hyperpolarized and inert gases.__
Our collaborator __Mitchell Albert__, __Thunder Bay Regional Research
Institute__, has been advancing the use of inert fluorinated gases that
can be breathed continuously in order to measure indicators of wash-in,
wash-out and air trapping with dynamic imaging protocols.  To compute
the wash-in and wash-out time constants on a pixelwise basis, access to
accurate and reliable image registration tools will be essential.

__3(c.3.12) Multimodality imaging studies of pulmonary diseases.__  Our collaborator
__Edwin van Beek__, __University of Edinburgh__, has been conducting various
multimodality studies, including the evaluation of pulmonary fibrosis
using both gadolinium-enhanced MRI and contrast-enhanced CT perfusion
imaging, and the assessment of lung nodules using PET-CT and CT
perfusion imaging.  These relatively new techniques would benefit from
quantitative analysis of contrast enhancement, and advanced image
registration and segmentation capabilities will both be necessary toward
this end.

__3(c.3.13) Computational imaging biomarkers for diverse thoracic malignancies.__
Our collaborator __Yoshiharu Ohno__, __Kobe University__, leads a comprehensive
program of multi-modality imaging (CT, MRI, PET, molecular imaging) research
on lung cancer, COPD, ILD, and pulmonary infectious diseases.  His myriad
image analysis needs include quantitative characterization of: lung
parenchyma and airway changes; regional perfusion, ventilation, and
metabolism from whole-lung perfusion and multi-modality metabolic imaging
studies; ultra-short TE MRI data; and regional and global kinematics.

studies above can be found in
the corresponding letter of support.  _The nature and diversity of the
imaging data collected for these studies will be a stringent test of the
ease of use, interactivity, and flexibility of the developed processing
and analysis software resources in this project.  Moreover, the studies
will yield valuable additions to the portfolio of use cases that serve
as primary reference and instructional material for the software._

__3(c.3.14) Sub-Aim 2a will disseminate the results of the project through open-source publication of the
code, annotated processed data, online user support, and conduct of hands-on training workshops.__
ITK is the leading open-source development system for medical image analysis, and in
recognition of this projectâ€™s value to the field, ITK will lend its infrastructure to provide long-term
hosting services for the developed resources as well as incorporate ITK-Lung training into its educational
programs that are offered in conjunction with major scientific (e.g., annual International Conference on
Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention) and user forums (e.g., hackathons); see Yoo
letter of support.  Further leveraging of ITK support will include formalized advisory input from its
core development team (of which the project team is a member), and access to and promotion within its
extensive outreach program.  Complete dissemination details can be found in the Resource Sharing Plan.

__3(c.4) Risks and alternatives__

While the proposed infrastructure is complex and integrates multiple cutting-edge technologies,
we do not anticipate significant problems in its development and consider the risk of failure of
the project to be very low. Our optimism is based on the extensive preliminary work that has been
performed over a significant period of time to successfully demonstrate feasibility of every aspect
of the project. Given the level of expertise and experience of our interdisciplinary team and the
well-defined scope of the software development and engineering problems, we are highly confident in a
successful outcome.

__3(c.5) Timeline__

__Aim 1:__  Software development will take place in Years 1-5, with Year 1 focused on refactoring of
existing ANTs-based code and integration with ITK; Year 2 focused on incorporation of new methods
to support expanded functionality beyond core algorithms; Year 3 focused on ITK-SNAP-based GUI implementation;
Year 4 focused on releasing a fully functional system; and Year 5 focused on incremental improvements
based on Aim 2 studies. Data collection and annotation (lung and lobes) for the multi-atlas libraries will take place in Years 1-2, followed by segmentations (vessels and airways) and template building in Year 3.
 __Aim 2:__  A preliminary version of the software will be deployed at
evaluation sites toward the end of Year 2
\textcolor{black}{(with quarterly software updates thereafter)},
and testing will run through Year 4.  Documentation and
