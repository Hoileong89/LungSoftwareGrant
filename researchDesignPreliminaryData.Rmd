__3(c.1.1) Generic ANTs core tools for image analysis and processing.__
The Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) package is a state-of-the-art, open-source software toolkit
for image registration, segmentation, and other basic medical image analysis functionality [@ANTsWebsite].
Several core programs comprising portions of the proposed pulmonary imaging analysis software framework
have been created and made available within ANTs (and either simultaneously or subsequently
made available in ITK).  However, these programs have more
general application and require pulmonary-specific tuning for the tasks targeted by
this project.  The following list comprises \textcolor{red}{available functionality proposed} for
tuning, subsequent extensions, documentation, tutorial generation, and the creation of
easy-to-use bash scripts for large-scale processing of pulmonary imaging data:

__ANTs image registration.__  One of the most important \textcolor{red}{innovations} in
medical image analysis is the \textcolor{red}{development} of image registration techniques capable of
mapping the highly complex variations seen in human anatomy.
Our team is well-recognized for seminal contributions to the field that date back to the
original elastic matching method of Bajcsy and co-investigators
[@Bajcsy:1982aa;@Bajcsy:1989aa;@Gee:1993aa]. Our most recent work, embodied in the ANTs
open-source, cross-platform toolkit for multiple modality image processing,
continues to set the standard in the field for
\textcolor{red}{lung} [@Murphy:2011aa], \textcolor{red}{brain} [@Klein:2009aa], \textcolor{red}{
and cardiac imaging} [@Tustison:2015ab].
ANTs not only encodes the most advanced results
in registration research, notably the Symmetric Normalization (SyN) algorithm for
diffeomorphisms [@Avants:2008aa], but also packages these within a full featured platform that
includes an extensive library of similarity measures, transformation types, and regularizers.
Recently, a thorough comparison with the original SyN algorithm was performed using a B-spline variant [@Tustison:2013ac].
This evaluation utilized multiple publicly available, annotated data sets and
demonstrated statistically significant improvement in label overlap measures.  As part of
that study, we produced the scripts ``antsRegistrationSyN.sh`` and
``antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh`` which provide a simple interface to our normalization tools
for brain-specific normalization and are two of the most widely used scripts in the ANTs
toolkit.  _Similar to the developments that we are proposing,
these scripts were extensively modified to serve as a follow-up entry into the EMPIRE10 lung image
registration challenge where B-spline SyN performed better than its original counterpart
on pulmonary data [@Tustison:2012aa],
\textcolor{red}{which had been the official top ranked entry since the inception of the challenge.}_

__Multi-modality template generation.__  Given the variability in anatomical shape across
populations, generating population- or
subject-specific optimal shape/intensity templates significantly enhances study potential
[@Avants:2010aa;@Tustison:2014aa].  First, an average template is estimated via a voxelwise
mean of all the individual subject images.  This estimate is iteratively updated by registering
each image to the current
template, performing a voxelwise average to create a new estimate, and then "reshaping"
this template based on the average inverse transformation which "moves" the template estimate
closer to the group mean---see Figure 1 for a cohort-specific multi-modality brain template
for females in the age range 50--60.
This functionality has proven to be a \textcolor{red}{highly valued} component of the ANTs toolkit, with significant
community adoption, for performing neuroimaging research (e.g.,
[@Avants:2015aa;@Datta:2012aa;@McMillan:2014aa;@Cook:2014aa;@Tustison:2014ad;@Tustison:2014ab]).
_\textcolor{red}{The same technology specialized to lung imaging will accelerate the
translation to the pulmonary domain of voxelwise studies that have transformed the
neuroimaging field, and may prove equally valuable and impactful to the pulmonary
research community} [@Tustison:2013ad]._


__Bayesian segmentation with spatial and Markov Random Field priors.__
Early statistically-based segmentation work appropriated NASA satellite image processing
software for classification of head tissues in 2-D MR images [@Vannier:1985aa]. Following
this work, many researchers adopted statistical methods for $n$-tissue anatomical brain
segmentation. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework is natural [@Dempster:1977aa]
given the "missing data" aspect of this problem. Core components of this type of work include
the explicit modeling of the tissue intensity values as statistical distributions
[@Cline:1990aa;@Kikinis:1992aa] and the use of Markov Random Field (MRF) modeling [@Geman:1984aa] for regularizing
the classification results [@Held:1997aa].  Spatial
prior probability maps of anatomical structures of interest are also employed within this framework
[@Van-Leemput:1999aa;@Ashburner:2005aa].  Although this particular segmentation
framework has significant application in the neuroimaging domain, it is also relevant
to other domains including functional
ventilation of the lung [@Tustison:2011aa].  _However, despite the numerous
developments which have been proposed
over the years within this area, there are only a few actual software
implementations.
This deficit inspired us to create our own Bayesian
segmentation framework [@Avants:2011aa] (denoted as Atropos), which we have made publicly
available within ANTs and has proven highly effective in quantification of
functional lung imaging data [@Tustison:2011aa;@Altes:2012aa;@Teague:2014aa;@Kirby:2014aa]._

__N4 bias correction.__  Critical to quantitative processing of MRI is the minimization of field
inhomogeneity effects which produce artificial low frequency intensity variation across the image.
Large-scale studies, such as ADNI, employ perhaps the most widely used bias correction algorithm,
N3 [@Sled:1998aa], as part of their standard \textcolor{red}{processing} protocol [@Boyes:2008aa].
In [@Tustison:2010aa], \textcolor{red}{we introduced "N4," which incorporates both an enhanced fitting
routine (including multi-resolution capabilities) and a modified optimization
formulation that produces a significant improvement over N3 in performance and
convergence behavior on a variety of data.  N4 has since become the new standard in the
field.}

__Joint label fusion for \textcolor{red}{multi-atlas} segmentation.__  Joint label fusion (JLF) is the current
state-of-the-art for propagating expert labelings from a reference atlas library onto new
instances of unlabeled data. Image registration is used to align the atlas library
(images plus segmentations) to a common space. A statistical model is then used to combine
the "guesses" from all the normalized atlas labels to provide a "best guess" estimate of
the target labeling. Several such algorithms have been developed and much effort has been
devoted to determining relative performance levels---see, for example, the recent MICCAI 2012
Grand Challenge and Workshop on Multi-Atlas Labeling.  The joint label fusion (JLF) algorithm of
[@Wang:2013aa;@Wang:2013ab] from our group is
\textcolor{red}{widely recognized as among the best performing, having placed
first in the MICCAI Grand Challenge}. JLF is capable
of predicting anatomical labels with accuracy that rivals expert anatomists
[@Yushkevich:2010aa]
and has proven its effectiveness \textcolor{red}{in multiple domains} [@MALF],
[@Tustison:2014ab], [@MALF]. \textcolor{red}{Importantly, we have}
successfully extended \textcolor{red}{JLF} to the challenging problem of applying prior-based information to lung and lobe
segmentation [@Tustison:2016aa]._

__Spatially adaptive denoising.__ Denoising is critical for data "cleaning" prior to subsequent processing such
as segmentation or spatial normalization.  ANTs implements a state-of-the-art
spatially adaptive version to
\textcolor{red}{patch-based} denoising recently proposed in [@Manjon:2010aa].

__Field-leading open-source implementations.__  The previously described core \textcolor{red}{software
functionality}, as well as several others, have been part of ANTs and
ITK development efforts for more than a decade.  The deficiency of publicly
available tools within the neuroscience community was the original motivation for the inception and
continued development of ANTs.  As a result, our team is well-recognized for our many
open-source advancements including important contributions to the
field of image registration outlined earlier.  Indeed, ANTs-based image registration serves
as the basis for the registration component of the latest version of the National Library of
Medicine Insight Toolkit programming library (http://www.itk.org), which is the leading
open-source platform for medical image analysis. _The
combination of state-of-the-art algorithms and feature-rich flexibility has translated
to top-placed rankings in major independent evaluations for core elements of the ANTs
toolkit:_

* SyN was a top performer in a fairly recent large-scale brain normalization evaluation [@Klein:2009aa].
* SyN also competed in the Evaluation of Methods for Pulmonary Image
REgistration 2010 (EMPIRE10) challenge [@Murphy:2011aa], where it was the top performer
for the benchmarks
used to assess lung registration accuracy and biological plausibility of the inferred
transform (i.e., boundary alignment, fissure alignment, landmark correspondence, and
displacement field topology).  The competition has continued to the present and
SyN has remained the top-ranked algorithm.
* The joint label fusion algorithm of [@Wang:2012aa;@Wang:2013aa] (coupled with SyN)
  was top-ranked in the MICCAI 2012 challenge for labeled brain data [@Landman2012]
  and in 2013 for labeled canine hind leg data [@Asman2013].
* The multivariate template capabilities in ANTs were combined with random forests to win
the Brain Tumor segmentation (BRATS) competition at MICCAI 2013 [@Tustison:2014aa].
* A B-spline variant of the SyN algorithm [@Tustison:2013ac] won the best paper award at the
STACOM 2014 workshop for cardiac motion estimation [@Tustison:2015ab].

![Core processing tools that have made the ANTs package one of the most popular neuroimaging
toolkits.  Fundamental processing tasks such as image registration, template generation,
bias correction, denoising, intensity-based segmentation, and joint label
fusion are first-in-class software components which have been utilized for
neuroimaging tasks such as brain extraction and cortical thickness estimation.
The target applications of these core tools have an immediate analog for lung-specific
tasks such as lung and lobe segmentation.](Figs/coreANtsToolsNeuro.png)

__3(c.1.2) Neuroimaging with ANTs as a model for the pulmonary community.__

ANTs takes advantage of the mature Insight Toolkit in providing a powerful framework for
building scripts and programs to facilitate processing of large neuroimaging studies.
In particular, ANTs has developed a very large user base by making openly available a
complete suite of fundamental processing capabilities, covering brain normalization
[@Avants:2011ab;@Avants:2014aa], brain template generation [@Avants:2010aa],
skull-stripping or brain extraction [@Avants:2010ab,@Tustison:2014ab],
prior-based brain tissue segmentation [@Avants:2011aa], cortical thickness estimation [@Das:2009aa;@Tustison:2014ab],
brain tumor segmentation [@Tustison:2014aa], and cortical labeling [@Wang:2013ab;@Wang:2013aa].  These tools have been
wrapped in easy-to-use, well-documented shell scripts that are accompanied by online
self-contained examples with developer-tuned parameters and are compatible with the
major cluster systems (e.g., SLURM, SGE, and PBS).  This project will implement a
similar strategy to support the lung imaging community, as demonstrated by the following
software utilities that have already begun to find widespread use among pulmonary research
groups:

<!--

* brain normalization [@Avants:2011ab;@Avants:2014aa] (https://github.com/stnava/BasicBrainMapping),
* brain template generation [@Avants:2010aa] (https://github.com/ntustison/TemplateBuildingExample),
* skull-stripping or brain extraction [@Avants:2010ab;@Tustison:2014ab] (https://github.com/ntustison/antsBrainExtractionExample),
* prior-based brain tissue segmentation [@Avants:2011ab] (https://github.com/ntustison/antsAtroposN4Example),
* cortical  thickness estimation [@Das:2009aa;@Tustison:2014ab] (https://github.com/ntustison/antsCorticalThicknessExample),
* brain tumor segmentation [@Tustison:2014aa] (https://github.com/ntustison/ANTsAndArboles), and
* cortical labeling [@Wang:2012aa;@Wang:2013aa] (https://github.com/ntustison/MalfLabelingExample).

All of these tools have been wrapped in easy-to-use, well-documented shell scripts
\textcolor{red}{which facilitate the processing of large studies.  Functionality
includes compatibility with the major cluster systems (e.g., SLURM, SGE, and PBS).
We have developed similar scripts targeting lung analyses which have begun to find
widespread use by lung research groups:}

-->

* intra-modal lung registration [@Tustison:2013ac] (https://github.com/ntustison/antsCtLungRegistrationExample),
* inter-modal lung registration [@Tustison:2013ac] (https://github.com/ntustison/ProtonCtLungMaskRegistration),
* functional lung segmentation [@Tustison:2011aa] (https://github.com/ntustison/He3LongitudinalAnalysis), and
* lung and lobe segmentation [@Tustison:2016aa] (https://github.com/ntustison/LungAndLobeEstimationExample).

<!--
For
example, the ANTs cortical thickness pipeline, as outlined in [@Tustison:2014ab], comprises
four major steps:  (1) bias correction, (2) brain extraction, (3) $n$-tissue segmentation,
and (4) cortical thickness estimation.  Each step requires its own set of ANTs tools with
appropriately tuned parameters. To maximize the utility of the pipeline for the interested
user, in [@Tustison:2014ab] we provide all the necessary programs (properly tuned) with
a minimal set of input data required to obtain good results for common data.  The result
is an easy-to-use script that can be invoked by the programmer and non-programmer alike to
obtain the desired processed data which outperforms the current state-of-the-art
[@Tustison:2014ab].
-->

<!--
An example command call for the ANTs cortical thickness pipeline is:
```bash
  # ANTs processing call for a single subject

  $ sh antsCorticalThickness.sh -d 3 \
                                -a IXI/T1/IXI002-Guys-0828-T1.nii.gz \
                                -e IXI/template/T_Template0.nii.gz \
                                -m IXI/template/T_template0ProbabilityMask.nii.gz \
                                -f IXI/template/T_template0ExtractionMask.nii.gz \
                                -p IXI/template/Priors/priors%d.nii.gz \
                                -o IXI/ANTsResults/IXI002-Guys-02828-
```
This approach to reducing the steep learning curve associated with many processing pipelines
has several benefits.  Bash is an extremely common command language that permits large-scale
processing.  Thus, running several jobs on a cluster infrastructure is straightforward with
this approach.  Such scripts are readable
by the interested user who can glean parameters as well as manually make changes.
