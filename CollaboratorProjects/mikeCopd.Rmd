_1) research project name and any participating team members (and affiliation) that should
be listed._

_2) brief (1 paragraph?  this can be boilerplate) description of research project (including
the relevant data)._

Associate Professor Mike Shim and his group have been actively developing 3D hyperpolarized
xenon-129 dissolved-phase MRI (HXe MRI) as a sensitive biomarker for accurately characterizing
phenotypes and severity of COPD. This protocol permits regional mapping of ventilation and
gas uptake by tissue and blood in human lungs with single breath hold
[@Dregely:2011aa;@Mugler:2010aa;@Qing:2014ab].  This project plans to establish connectivity
between these advanced HXe MRI imaging signatures and important clinical outcomes of COPD to
establish HXe MRI as a novel clinical diagnostic tool. They anticipate that this new biomarker
tool will naturally lead to deeper mechanistic understanding of COPD at the molecular-physiologic
and clinical levels and support identification of potential pathophysiologic derrangement
associated with COPD and a new method to accurately predict therapeutic response to current
standard COPD therapies. Refinement of HXe MRI as a pulmonary diagnostic tool is anticipated
to encourage development of new clinical interventions.

To date, they have imaged and evaluated 61 subjects using their HXe MRI technique.  This
preliminary cohort consists of (1) healthy non-smokers
($n=28$) and (2) patients with symptomatic COPD ($n=33$) due to extensive cigarette smoke
exposure ($>20$ pack-year).  Evaluation includes spirometry measures based on ATS/ERS
guidelines and NHANES III [@Miller:2005aa;@Miller:2005ab] and classification from the GOLD
guideline [@GOLD].  Preliminary quantitation includes correlation analysis with HXe MRI-derived
imaging signatures. They plan to expand this
preliminary study to another cohort of 40 subjects with COPD.

_3) brief (ditto) description of project significance/innovation/impact._

To the best of their knowledge, HXe MRI is the
first non-invasive imaging technique that can provide regional information about three unique
characteristics of lung function: lung ventilation, size and connectedness of distal alveolar
airspaces, and HXe gas transfer from airspaces to red blood cells. HXe MRI, therefore, is
anticipated to overcome the limitation
of pulmonary function testing (PFT) which only provides physiologic parameters of the lung
as a whole unit, and High Resolution CT (HRCT) which only provides anatomic characterization
without physiologic information.
They anticipate that the HXe MRI will detect pathologic changes present in COPD patients with
high sensitivity and specificity previously unattainable by current clinical standard
(PFT and HRCT). Moreover, HXe MRI can determine whether gas transfer
abnormalities are due to impaired ventilation or reduced gas-exchange, and provide new
insights into pathogenesis of COPD in individual patients.

_4) brief description of enabling role (e.g., tasks, needs, etc) for research project of
lung image analysis/processing software proposed for development in this grant; in other
words, the specific needs of research project, that would be met/advanced by the software
tools proposed for development in the grant._

Crucial to the success of establishing the utility of HXe MRI as a sensitive biomarker
for accurately characterizing COPD phenotypes is quantification of imaging signatures in
an automated and robust fashion.  Identification of ventilation dead space ($V_D$)
for correlation with GOLD classification will utilize the previously described
ventilation-based segmentation approach [@Tustison:2011aa].  In order to determine lobar
values of HXe MRI, they will utilize the recently proposed lobar estimation algorithm
[@Tustison:2015aa] in both proton MRI and CT.
