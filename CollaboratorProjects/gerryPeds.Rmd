_2) brief (1 paragraph?  this can be boilerplate) description of research project (including
the relevant data)._

Advances in rapid image sequencing methods have facilitated the acquisition of high-quality
hyperpolarized gas MR images in pre-school children [@Altes:2006aa]. Furthermore improvements in image
processing and signal intensity analysis can accurately measure lung volume compartments [@Tustison:2011aa].
Dr. Gerry Teague's group is applying these innovations in children with asthma to study whether the lung
defect volume % as measured by hyperpolarized lung MRI correlates with a range of clinical
features. They hypothesize the ventilation defect volume % would be higher in children with
severe asthma, and correlate not only with the degree of airflow limitation, but indicators
of asthma control, treatment, and inflammation.

Preliminary analysis included 31 children with current asthma based on physician diagnosis
(median age = 10 years, minimum age = 3 years, maximum age 17 years).  Lung function was
measured clinically according to ATS guidelines for precision and reproducibility and expressed
according to standard population reference values [@Hankinson:1999aa].  Hyperpolarized <sup>3</sup>He
MR imaging acquisition was performed within a few weeks of enrollment according to a protocol
developed for children. Inhaled beta agonists were withheld for four hours before the MRI procedure.
Future processing and analysis includes investigating lobar differences in this original
data set.

_3) brief (ditto) description of project significance/innovation/impact._

Precise measurement of ventilation volumes by hyperpolarized noble gas MRI not only has the
potential to resolve the spatial and temporal characteristics of gas distribution in
children with asthma, but could also expand clinically relevant information in regards to
asthma severity and its features.  In the past simple computer-assisted systems [@Woodhouse:2005aa] or
hand counts of visual defects were used to estimate the ventilation defect volume [@Altes:2001aa].
By developing more advanced techniques (in terms of acquisition and analysis), Dr. Teague
and his group hope to facilitate
rapid conversion of complex hyperpolarized gas signal data into volume compartments for
clinical applications.

_4) brief description of enabling role (e.g., tasks, needs, etc) for research project of
lung image analysis/processing software proposed for development in this grant; in other
words, the specific needs of research project, that would be met/advanced by the software
tools proposed for development in the grant._

Absolutely crucial to the advanced techniques being developed by Dr. Teague and his group
are sophisticated image analysis tools like the ones being proposed.  For example,
the ventilation-based segmentation described in [@Tustison:2011aa] is being used to determine
volumetric compartments based on lung function.  Additional ``cleaning'' necessary for these
data include denoising techniques [@Manjon:2010aa] implemented and made available in ANTs.
Lobe estimation will be possible by refining the techniques originally described in
[@Tustison:2015aa].
