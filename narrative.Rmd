{\bf Narrative}
\end{center}

This project will improve pulmonary scientistsâ€™ ability to explore clinical hypotheses
concerning the structure and function of the human lung using multi-modal imaging data.
Scientific research has been significantly enhanced by recent emphases on open-data and
open-source tools.  This success has been quite apparent within the neuroimaging community
but no such publicly available computational resources exist for pulmonary imaging.
By providing publicly available, user-friendly, widely interoperable, and extensively validated
tools for pulmonary imaging analysis, the project will enable
scientists to leverage modern imaging analysis technologies more effectively in answering basic
science questions about the lung, which has the potential for clinical insights and
advancements.
