\end{center}

This project will improve pulmonary scientistsâ€™ ability to explore clinical hypotheses
concerning the structure and function of the human lung using multi-modal imaging data.
Scientific research has been significantly enhanced by recent emphases on open-data and
open-source tools.  This success has been quite apparent within the neuroimaging community
but no such publicly available computational resources exist for pulmonary imaging.
By providing publicly available, user-friendly, widely interoperable, and extensively validated
tools for pulmonary imaging analysis and mapping, the project will enable a broad field of
scientists to leverage modern imaging technologies more effectively in answering basic
science questions about the lung, which will lead to clinical insights and
advancements.
