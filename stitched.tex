\section{Specific Aims}\label{specific-aims}

The development and proliferation of quantitative image analysis methods
have accelerated research efforts and are having an increasingly
significant impact in modern clinical practice. Although the research
utility of these techniques has been amply demonstrated in determining
longitudinal and groupwise trends, they are also becoming increasingly
relevant in the clinical setting in providing biomarkers for aiding
patient diagnoses, monitoring disease progression, and determining
treatment outcomes. Increases in the capabilities and accessibility of
computational facilities and a corresponding sophistication in
computational algorithms have only made such practices more commonplace.

One of the most significant hurdles in adopting more quantitative
clinical practices and exploring additional novel research pathways is
the availability of accurate, robust, and easy-to-use image analysis
tools. Historically, the research and clinical communities (and their
overlap) have significantly benefited from the development and
proliferation of imaging-related analysis packages, particularly those
softwares which have been tailored for specific application domains.
Although several such established packages exist for neuroimaging
research (e.g., FSL, FreeSurfer, AFNI, SPM), no such package exists for
pulmonary imaging analysis. The primary goal of this proposal is to
develop a robust, open-source image analysis toolkit and dissemination
platform specifically targeted at the pulmonary research community.

Although methodological research is continually being presented at
conferences and published in various venues, the unfortunate reality is
that much of this work exists strictly in ``advertisement'' form.
Oftentimes the underlying code is unavailable to other researchers or is
implemented in a limited manner (i.e., strictly as proof-of-concept
software). Frequently, crucial parameter choices are omitted in the
corresponding publication(s) which makes external implementations
difficult. In addition, the data used to showcase the proposed
methodologies are often private and actual data visualization is limited
to carefully selected snapshots for publication (i.e., advertisement)
purposes which might not be representative of algorithmic performance.
Finally, many of these analysis methods are patented and/or integrated
into proprietary commercial software packages which severely limits
accessibility to researchers.

As a corrective alternative, this proposal will provide an open-source
software toolkit targeted for pulmonary research. As principal
developers of the popular, open-source ANTs (Advanced Normalization
Tools) package, we have extensive experience in the development of
well-written software that has gained much traction in the neuroscience
community and propose to make a similar impact in the pulmonary
community with this proposal. Specifically, we plan to provide methods
for core pulmonary image analysis tasks across multiple modalities, many
of which we have proposed previously in past publications. These basic
tasks include pulmonary image registration, template building for
cross-sectional and longitudinal (i.e., respiratory cycle) analyses,
functional and structural lung image segmentation, and computation of
quantitative image indices as potential imaging biomarkers. In addition
to the software, we will provide additional data, documentation, and
tutorial materials consistent with open-science principles. Formally,
this proposal is defined by the following specific aims:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \textbf{Specific Aim 1:} \textbf{Develop a set of open-source software
  tools for CT, proton, and He-3 pulmonary computational analysis.}
  These open-source software tools will specifically target pulmonary
  image analysis and comprise core application functions such as
  inspiratory/expiratory registration for inferring pulmonary
  kinematics, ventilation-based segmentation, lung and lobe estimation,
  airway segmentation, and calculation of clinical indices for
  characterization of lung development and pathology. To maximize
  usability, much (if not all) of the actual code will be developed and
  distributed within the Insight Toolkit of the National Library of
  Medicine.
\item
  \textbf{Specific Aim 2:} \textbf{Provide multiple sets of multi-modal
  annotated lung data (CT, proton, and He3) for unrestricted public
  use.} In addition to the public unavailability of the algorithms used
  to produce the results discussed in certain publications, the input
  and output data is also typically not available. Such availability
  would be invaluable to other researchers in the community for
  appropriation for their own purposes including algorithmic performance
  assessment and running the proposed prior-based methods requiring
  annotated input data.
\item
  \textbf{Specific Aim 3:} \textbf{Evaluate and disseminate the
  developed resources by leveraging input data from multiple partner
  investigators.} This aim will evaluate and refine the developed
  methodology within the real-world context of pulmonary research being
  carried out at various partner sites
  \textcolor{red}{(e.g., University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania, \ldots,
  need to add others)}. We will disseminate the results of the project
  through open-source distribution of the software, data and write-ups,
  online user support, and conduct of hands-on training workshops.
\end{itemize}

\section{Research Strategy}\label{research-strategy}

\subsection{\textbf{3(a) Significance}}\label{a-significance}

The increased utilization of imaging for both research and clinical
purposes has furthered the demand for quantitative image analysis
techniques. The use of these computational techniques are motivated by
the need for less subjectivity and more standardization in medical image
interpretation, increased speed and automation in diagnosis, and greater
robustness and accuracy for determining biological correlates with
imaging findings. For example, in the area of pharmaceutical development
and testing, imaging biomarkers are crucial. In order to determine
fundamental study parameters such as drug safety and effectiveness,
quantitative assessments derived from imaging measures must be objective
and reproducible {[}1{]} which is often difficult without computational
aid given the intra- and inter-reader variability in radiological
practice {[}2, 3{]}. Additionally, the exciting possibilities associated
with ``big data'' and the potential for improvement in individualized,
evidence-based medicine has also increased the need for sophisticated
data transformation and machine learning techniques.

Well-vetted and publicly available software is a significant benefit to
targeted research communities. For example, the neuroscience community
has greatly benefited from highly evolved software packages such as
FreeSurfer {[}4{]}, the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) {[}5{]}, the
Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) package {[}6{]}, and the
Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) package {[}7{]}. Performing a
pubmed query for any one of these softwares every year for the past
decade (cf Figure 1) illustrates the growing use of such packages and
the research studies that are produced as a result. However, despite the
absolute number of articles produced using such software and the
year-by-year usage increase, no such analogous set of tools exist for
pulmonary-specific research. In fact, in a recent review of CT- and
MRI-derived biomarkers for pulmonary clinical investigation, the
authorial consensus is that ``universally available image analysis
software'' is a major hinderance to more widespread usage of such
imaging biomarkers {[}8{]}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{stitched_files/figure-latex/pubmedQuery-1.pdf}
\caption{Number of articles per year which cite publicly available
neuroimaging analysis packages (specifically, FreeSurfer, AFNI, FSL, and
SPM). Although the benefits seem clear for the neuroscience community,
analogous efforts within the pulmonary community have yet to be
undertaken despite consensus amongst researchers and clinicians
regarding the utility of such offerings.}
\end{figure}

Medical image analysis libraries (e.g., the NIH-sponsored Insight
ToolKit) provide extensive algorithmic capabilities for a range of
generic image processing tasks. However, tailored software packages for
certain application domains (e.g., lung image analysis) are not
available despite the vast number of algorithms that have been proposed
in the literature. Note that the goals of this proposal would
significantly support the National Library of Medicine's own open-source
directives in that all software would be developed using the established
Insight ToolKit's coding and testing standards with the eventual idea
that much (if not all) of the actual code would be contributed for
inclusion in future versions of the Insight ToolKit as we have done in
the past. It should also be noted that open-source software, in general,
has documented benefits within the targeted communities for which it is
developed and supported. In addition to the increase in research output
illustrated earlier, open-source permits students and researchers to
learn specific computational techniques in a social environment {[}9{]}.
This, in turn, provides motivation for user-based support including
potential contributions such as bug fixes and feature additions.
Additional analyses have shown the tremendous cost savings that
open-source software yields {[}10{]}. Furthermore, it should be
highlighted that open-source development and distribution within a
large, and well-invested community (such as ITK) takes advantage of
Linus's law, i.e., ``given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow," for
producing robust software.

\subsection{\textbf{3(b) Innovation}}\label{b-innovation}

\subsubsection{3(b.1) Open source pulmonary algorithmic
innovation}\label{b.1-open-source-pulmonary-algorithmic-innovation}

Given the lack of open-source solutions for pulmonary image analysis,
the proposal goals would produce an innovative platform for performing
such research. Similar to the brain-specific algorithms provided in our
ANTs toolkit, our novel and useful proposal would include the most
essential algorithms for analyzing lung images from different modalities
including CT, 3He, and proton MRI. Many algorithms have been proposed in
various technical venues but that which we propose would provide
well-vetted and easy-to-use implementations of specific robust
methodologies for pulmonary medical image analysis, many of which have
been developed by our group. To facilitate the usage of these
algorithms, we will provide several self-contained online examples
(complete with data).

\subsubsection{3(b.2) Publicly available multi-site data as a
reproducible and didactic
component}\label{b.2-publicly-available-multi-site-data-as-a-reproducible-and-didactic-component}

An additional innovative component we are proposing is the inclusion of
complete study data and detailed instructions for generating
reproducible, multimodality pulmonary studies using the proposed package
with input data from several of our external collaborators and
colleagues. Specifically, we have asked several scientists and
researchers who are familiar with our work to provide imaging data of
various modalities which we will then process using the proposed
toolkit. These processed data will then not only be returned to the
corresponding providers with detailed instructions on reproducing these
results in their own labs but will also be provided to the public for
any interested researcher to reproduce the results. Given the different
image acquisition sources, this strategy should also demonstrate the
robustness of our tools.

Included in these analyses will be analyses of our own data. Any
clinical findings of interest will be published in traditional venues
(e.g., Chest). In addition, we will provide all image data and the
quantitative analysis scripts as a companion release to accompany the
paper (e.g., see previous similar offerings from our group {[}11,
12{]}). Such a comprehensive clinical investigation using these tools
will not only provide insight into the specifics of certain pulmonary
pathologies but will also provide a reproducible mechanism for using the
tools created with this proposal.

\subsection{\textbf{3(c) Research design}}\label{c-research-design}

\subsubsection{3(c.1) Preliminary data}\label{c.1-preliminary-data}

\subsubsection{3(c.1.1) ANTs and the neuroimaging
community}\label{c.1.1-ants-and-the-neuroimaging-community}

Deficiency of publicly available tools within the neuroscience community
has been one of the primary motivations for the inception and continued
development of our Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). Our team is
well-recognized for seminal contributions to the field of image
registration that date back to the original elastic matching method of
Bajcsy and co-investigators {[}13--15{]}. Our most recent work, embodied
in the ANTs open-source, cross-platform toolkit for multiple modality
image processing (\url{http://picsl.upenn.edu/} software/ants/),
continues to set the standard in the field. ANTs not only encodes the
most advanced results in registration research, notably the Symmetric
Normalization (SyN) algorithm for diffeomorphisms {[}16{]}, but also
packages these within a full featured platform that includes an
extensive library of similarity measures, transformation types, and
regularizers. Indeed, it serves as the basis for the registration
component of the latest version of the National Library of Medicine
Insight Toolkit (ITK) programming library (\url{http://www.itk.org}).
The combination of state-of-the-art algorithms and feature-rich
flexibility has translated to top-placed rankings in major independent
evaluations for certain elements of the ANTs toolkit:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  SyN was a top performer in a fairly recent large-scale brain
  normalization evaluation {[}17{]}.
\item
  SyN also competed in the Evaluation of Methods for Pulmonary Image
  REgistration 2010 (EMPIRE10) challenge {[}18{]} where it was the top
  performer for the benchmarks used to assess lung registration accuracy
  and biological plausibility of the inferred transform (i.e., boundary
  alignment, fissure alignment, landmark correspondence, and
  displacement field topology).
\item
  The joint label fusion algorithm of {[}19, 20{]} (coupled with SyN)
  performed well in the MICCAI 2012 challenge for labeled brain data
  {[}21{]} and in 2013 for labeled canine hind leg data {[}22{]}.
\item
  The multivariate template capabilities in ANTs were combined with
  random forests to win the Brain Tumor segmentation (BRATS) competition
  at MICCAI 2013 {[}23{]}.
\item
  A B-spline variant of the SyN algorithm {[}11{]} won the best paper
  award at the STACOM 2014 workshop for cardiac motion estimation
  {[}24{]}.
\end{itemize}

ANTs takes advantage of the mature Insight ToolKit in providing an
optimal software framework for building scripts and programs
specifically for neuroimaging. For example, the following core
neuroimage processing algorithms have been made available through our
ANTs toolkit (complete with online self-contained examples with
developer-tuned parameters) and have been used extensively by our group
and others:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  brain normalization {[}16, 25{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/stnava/BasicBrainMapping}),
\item
  brain template generation {[}26{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/ntustison/TemplateBuildingExample}),
\item
  skull-stripping or brain extraction {[}12, 27{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/ntustison/antsBrainExtractionExample}),
\item
  prior-based brain tissue segmentation {[}16{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/ntustison/antsAtroposN4Example}),
\item
  cortical thickness estimation {[}12, 28{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/ntustison/antsCorticalThicknessExample}),
\item
  brain tumor segmentation {[}23{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/ntustison/ANTsAndArboles}), and
\item
  cortical labeling {[}19, 20{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/ntustison/MalfLabelingExample}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{3(c.1.2) The significance of ANTs for the pulmonary
imaging
community}\label{c.1.2-the-significance-of-ants-for-the-pulmonary-imaging-community}

Analogously, several algorithmic categories exist for lung image
analysis which, as we have stated previously, do not exist in any
comprehensive, publicly available package. An extensive survey
concentrating on the years 1999--2004 is given in {[}29{]} which covers
computer aided diagnosis of lung disease and lung cancer in CT (i.e.,
detection and tracking of pulmonary nodules) and provides an overview of
the many relevant segmentation methods for pulmonary structures.
Although many algorithms existed at the time, continued technical
development has only increased the number of available algorithms. The
following is a small sampling of more recently reported techniques for
CT analysis:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  whole lung differentiation from the chest wall (e.g., {[}30--33{]})
\item
  bronchial structure extraction (e.g., {[}34, 35{]} and the many
  submissions to the recent Extraction of Airways from CT (ExACT)
  challenge of the 2nd International Workshop on Pulmonary Image
  Analysis {[}36{]}),
\item
  vasculature segmentation (e.g., {[}37, 38{]}),
\item
  lobe and/or fissure detection (e.g., {[}39, 40{]}),
\item
  feature extraction and classification (e.g., {[}41--43{]}), and
\item
  nodule detection (e.g., {[}Reference 44;{]} and the many submissions
  to the Automatic Nodule Detection (ANODE09) challenge of the 2009 CAD
  Conference of SPIE Medical Imaging {[}45{]}).
\end{itemize}

Since this list is restricted to CT image analysis, inclusion of
additional techniques specific to other modalities will have additional
benefit. For example, ventilation-based segmentation for analysis of
ventilation lung imaging (e.g., {[}46{]} which was implemented within
the ANTs framework) will also have significant impact in a comprehensive
lung image analysis suite. Since most of the tools that have been
developed within the ANTs framework have generic applicability, crucial
to the development of our proposed toolset will be domain-specific
experience. For example, although ANTs performance in brain registration
has been independently evaluated and found to be of relatively high
quality {[}Klein2009{]}, tailoring our registration tool in the EMPIRE10
challenge (Evaluation of Methods for Pulmonary Image REgistration 2010)
required significant empirically-based tuning. In addition, new
innovations in diffeomorphic registration technology has led to a
Symmetric Normalization B-spline variant which has demonstrated accurate
normalizations {[}11{]}, and transformations which are particularly
well-suited for pulmonary data {[}47{]}.

\subsubsection{3(c.2) Specific Aim 1: To develop a set of open-source
software tools for CT, proton, and 3He pulmonary computational
analysis.}\label{c.2-specific-aim-1-to-develop-a-set-of-open-source-software-tools-for-ct-proton-and-3he-pulmonary-computational-analysis.}

Although the proposed software library would be extendable based on new
methodological developments and continued analysis experience, the core
development will include several fundamental tools:

\textbf{B-spline-based Symmetric Normalization.} A thorough comparison
with the well-known ANTs SyN algorithm {[}48{]} was performed with a
B-spline variant {[}11{]}. This evaluation utilized multiple publicly
available, annotated brain data sets and demonstrated statistically
significant improvement in label overlap measures. As part of that
study, we produced the scripts \texttt{antsRegistrationSyN.sh} and
\texttt{antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh} which provide a simple interface to
our normalization tools for brain-specific normalization based on our
extensive experience.

Similarly, we used the EMPIRE10 challenge framework to provide an
additional comparison in the context of pulmonary CT image registration
{[}49{]}. Registration accuracy is based on a combination of factors
including lung boundary and fissure overlap, landmark correspondence,
and topology considerations in the displacement field. In this domain,
the B-spline variant showed a separate performance gain and has since
become the preferred transformation model for small deformation image
registration problems (an additional domain is cardiac MRI where it
recently won the best paper award {[}24{]}). As part of the development,
we will provide simple script-based interfaces for lung-specific
normalization tasks.

\textbf{Multi-feature CT and multi-modal MRI template generation.} Given
the variability in lung shape across populations and the lack of
publicly available lung atlases, generating population- or
subject-specific templates significantly enhances study potential.
Although the template construction algorithm described in {[}26{]} was
applied to T1-weighted brain data (with the extension of multimodal data
described in {[}23{]}), it is sufficiently generic such that it is
easily applied to pulmonary data.

For example, in Fig. 4, we illustrate the major processing components of
a recent study analyzing local changes based on a pulmonary treatment
plan {[}50{]}. This study employed several of the tools we are proposing
for inclusion in the specified aims. The firs major component is the
construction of a single-subject 3He/proton MRI template for all five
imaging time points. This step generates the statistical coordinate
system for the voxelwise regression analysis of the normalized
intensities to determine correlation with expected treatment effects.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figs/longitudinalStudy.png}
\caption{Voxelwise regression analysis to determine image-based response
to treatment. First, a multi-modal, single-subject template is created
to bring all time point images to the same coordinate system. 4-D
segmentation is performed on the longitudinal time series of 3-D image
volumes. Treatment effects are expected to follow the simplified
treatment hypothesis illustrated with the dashed blue line in the plot
on the right. To explore how the longitudinal change in expected
ventilation follows this treatment hypothesis with image data, we smooth
the aligned expected ventilation maps (to account for potential
voxelwise misalignments) and then quantify how the voxelwise intensities
regress with the simplified treatment hypothesis. This quantification is
visualized using the correlation maps depicted in the template space
(top right). Positive correlations with the expected treatment effect
are rendered in orange whereas negative correlations are rendered in
blue.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Atlas-based lung segmentation.} Identification of anatomical
structure in MRI is often a crucial preprocessing step for
quantification of morphological features or ventilation information from
functional images. Quantitative regional analysis often requires the
identification of lung and lobar anatomy. Although much algorithmic
research for lung segmentation has been reported in the CT literature
{[}51{]}, co-opting such technologies is complicated by MRI-specific
issues such as RF coil inhomogeneity, presence and resolution of
structural detail, and the absence of a physically-based intensity
scaling.

We recently proposed a multi-atlas approach for automatically segmenting
the left and right lungs in proton MRI {[}47{]}. Multi-atlas approaches
to segmentation have proven highly successful in neuroimaging {[}19,
20{]} and these methods translate readily to the pulmonary domain.
Wherease many current strategies for lung image segmentation employ
low-level processing techniques based on encodable heuristics,
consensus-based strategies, in contrast, optimize the prior knowledge
applied to a specific segmentation problem (cf Figure 3). The evaluation
of our proposed method {[}47{]} demonstrated good performance with
Jaccard overlap measures for the left and right lungs being
$0.966 \pm 0.018$ and $0.970 \pm 0.016$, respectively. One of the
benefits of this approach is that can also be applied effectively to
pulmonary CT.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figs/lungEstimation.png}
\caption{Sample lung and lobe estimation results in both proton MRI and
CT using our atlas-based strategy. (Left) Lung segmentation and lobe
estimation results for the given proton MRI. Although lobe estimation is
dependent solely on the warped atlases, we are able to obtain accurate
estimates of lobes which are useful for more regional analysis and
provide a more intuitive and universal subdivision of the lungs than
previous partitioning schemes. (Right) The utility of this method
extends to CT where the integrity of lobar anatomical markers (such as
the lack of fissures illustrated by the red arrows) have been
compromised due to disease.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Atlas-based lobe estimation.} For regional investigation of
certain lung pathologies and conditions, it is often useful to quantify
measurements of interest within more localized regions, such as the
lobes. However there is little (if any) usable information in proton MRI
for image-based lobar segmentation which has led to alternative
geometric subdivisions which are ad hoc, non-anatomical, and do not
adequately address intra- and inter-subject correspondences. However, we
can take advantage of inter-subject similarities in lobar geometry to
provide a prior-based estimation of lobar divisions using a consensus
labeling approach (cf Figure 2).

To generate the lobe segmentation in a target proton or CT lung image,
we first generate the binary whole lung mask using the whole lung
atlas-based estimation. We then register the set of CT lung masks which
have beeen expertly annotated to the target binary lung mask using the
B-spline SyN registration approach described earlier {[}11{]}.
Subsequently, we warp the set of CT lobe labels to the target image
using the CT mask-to-target mask transformation. Since we have no
intensity information inside the target lung mask and CT atlas lung
masks, we use a simply majority voting strategy to generate the optimal
labeling for the target image. Following the majority voting, we remove
any labelings outside the lung mask and assign any unlabeled voxels with
the label closest in distance to that voxel. This methodology is more
thoroughly described in {[}47{]} where we showed that lobar overlap
measures in proton MRI were on par with the state-of-the-art CT methods
where fissure information is actually visible (left upper:
$0.882 \pm 0.059$, left lower: $0.868 \pm 0.06$, right upper:
$0.852 \pm 0.067$, right middle: $0.657 \pm 0.130$, right lower:
$0.873 \pm 0.063$).

\textbf{Ventilation quantification.} Automated or semiautomated
approaches for classifying areas of varying degrees of ventilation are
of potential benefit for pulmonary functional analysis. In {[}46{]}, we
presented an automated algorithmic pipeline for ventilation-based
partitioning of the lungs in hyperpolarized 3He and 129Xe MRI. Without
ground truth data for evaluation, we used a consensus labeling approach
{[}52{]} to simultaneously estimate the true segmentation from given
``raters'' which included the segmentation from our automated approach
and the manual tracings of three trained individuals. In terms of
combined specificity and sensitivity, our automated algorithm
demonstrated superior performance with the added benefit of being
reproducible and less time-consuming.

Since the initial development, we have continued to improve this
segmentation pipeline by incorporating an iterative
bias-correction/segmetnation estimation scheme. An additional component
that improves results is an ANTs-based implementation of the patch-based
denoising protocol described in {[}53{]}. Example longitudinal
segmentation results are provided in Figure 4.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figs/prePostAlbuterol.png}
\caption{Pulmonary functional segmentation using the algorithmic
framework first described in {[}46{]} for hyperpolarized 3He MRI. These
data were taken from a current study looking at the implications in
ventilation pre- and post-albuterol intake including an additional
acquisition at some delay period following the post-albuterol imaging.
The ventilation-based segmentation is as follows: red = no ventilation,
green = poorly ventilated, blue = normally ventilated, and yellow =
well-ventilated. Note the improvement in both the qualitative assessment
of the ventilation map (top) and the corresponding segmentation time
course (bottom) followed by an approximate return to pre-albuterol
conditions following the delay period.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Quantitative CT indices.} Imaging biomarkers for characterizing
emphysema in CT have have been well researched, although there are ample
opportunities to refine these methods as well as to introduce more
advanced approaches. Examples of the latter include texture analysis for
identifying the centrilobular and groundglass opacities and fractal and
connectivity approaches to differentiate centrilobular from panlobular
emphysema. The indices for CT image analysis can roughly be divided into
those that characterize the pulmonary parenchyma: volumetric tissue
(e.g., {[}54, 55{]}), distribution of low attenuation areas (LAA) (e.g.,
{[}56, 57{]}), cooccurrence and run-length matrix features (e.g., {[}41,
58{]}), attenuation statistics (e.g., {[}59, 60{]}), deformation
measures (e.g., {[}61, 62{]}), and stochastic fractal dimension features
(e.g., {[}41, 60{]}) and those that characterize the airways (e.g.,
{[}63--65{]}).

The former are important for subjects with an emphysematous component of
disease, whereas the latter are important for subjects with a bronchitic
component of disease. An important premise of this proposal is that many
of these measurements can also be directly applied to discriminative
analysis using 3He MRI for a variety of lung diseases. These indices can
also be studied not only at any particular single time point, but also
for changes with time. The addition of quantitative morphologic
measurements of the airways provides an assessment of the contribution
of airway changes to chronic lung disease.

\input{ct_table.tex}

Table 1 provides an overview of these types of discriminative
measurements that can be used for CT and 3He lung assessment. We have
already implemented many of these image features and have contributed
the result of our work to the Insight Toolkit (ITK) of the National
Institutes of Health (e.g., {[}66, 67{]}). As an open-source repository
for medical image analysis algorithms, contribution of our work to the
ITK allows researchers full access to the latest image analysis
algorithms in addition to avoiding research redundancy. It is also
beneficial in that the entire ITK community participates in the vetting
of the software library.

\textbf{Airway and vessel segmentation.} In describing the quantitative
CT lung indices, it was pointed out that lung airway morphology has been
previously utilized as a biomarker for disease characterization.
Additionally, there are other potential uses motivating the inclusion of
airway segmentation in any pulmonary image analysis toolkit (cf Figure
5). In an evaluation of 15 airway segmentation algorithms {[}68{]} it
was shown that no algorithm was capable of ``extracting more than 77\%
of the reference.'' Our plan is to initially provide an implementation
of the algorithm developed by our group {[}69{]}. Instead of mixing
airway segmentation and leakage detection at every iteration, this work
divides this problem into a hypothesis generation of thin airway paths
and a post processing procedure of removing leakage path candidates. For
the purpose of generating as many hypotheses as possible, a novel speed
function for thin airways is used. To exclude leakage regions, a novel
cost function defined on the whole path candidate is used. Such a scheme
is more flexible when evaluating the whole path and can be viewed as
complementary to current region growing methods.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Potential clinical use case for identifying the feeding airway
branch path to the ventilation defect. The functional ventilation image
is normalized to the corresponding CT image. The airways are segmented
in the individual subject space. After identification of the ventilation
defect of interest, we can automatically determine the bronchiole
pathway from the trachea to the defect.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Specific Aim 2.} To provide multiple sets of multi-modal
annotated lung data (CT, proton, and He3) for public use.

\textbf{Specific Aim 3.} Evaluate and disseminate multiple complete
studies with input data from multiple investigators to showcase the
utility of the tools and data provided with this proposal.

\subsubsection{Anticipated difficulties}\label{anticipated-difficulties}

Signal intensity in the lungs is poor in areas of low ventilation. COPD
and asthma are obstructive lung diseases which exhibit focal areas of
decreased signal intensity on 3HeMRI which are thought to correspond to
areas of reduced ventilation. These ventilation defects severely inhibit
our ability to detect the lung boundaries for proper segmentation. Also,
most of the COPD and asthmatic patients will have ventilation defects
with the moderate asthmatics having greater than 1 defect per slice also
negatively affecting boundary delineation. Note that there are similar
issues for CT images of severe pathologies. However, given the shape and
intensity prior statistics contained by our 3HeMRI and CT lung
templates, it is expected that the templates, in combination with our
proposed segmentation algorithms, will be sufficient to provide a good
initialization for subsequent manual segmentation if they do not yield
an adequate segmentation result. The CT data, which provides excellent
contrast between the lung and chest wall, can also be used to inform the
3HeMRI segmentation.
