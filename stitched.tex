\section{2 Specific Aims}\label{specific-aims}

The development and proliferation of quantitative image analysis methods
have accelerated research efforts and are having an increasingly
significant impact in modern clinical practice. Although the research
utility of these techniques has been amply demonstrated in determining
longitudinal and groupwise trends, they are also becoming increasingly
relevant in the clinical setting in providing biomarkers for aiding
patient diagnoses, monitoring disease progression, and determining
treatment outcomes. Increases in the capabilities and accessibility of
computational facilities and a corresponding sophistication in
computational algorithms have only made such practices more commonplace.

One of the most significant hurdles in adopting more quantitative
clinical practices and exploring additional novel research pathways is
the availability of accurate, robust, and easy-to-use image analysis
tools. Historically, the research and clinical communities (and their
overlap) have significantly benefited from computational image analysis
packages, particularly those softwares which have been tailored for
specific application domains. Although several such established packages
exist for neuroimaging research (e.g., FSL, FreeSurfer, AFNI, SPM),
\emph{no such package exists for pulmonary imaging analysis. The primary
goal of this proposal is to develop a robust, open-source image analysis
toolkit and dissemination platform specifically targeted at the
pulmonary research community.}

Although methodological research is continually being presented at
conferences and published in various venues, the unfortunate reality is
that much of this work exists strictly in ``advertisement'' form.
Oftentimes the underlying code is unavailable to other researchers or is
implemented in a limited manner (i.e., strictly as proof-of-concept
software). Frequently, crucial parameter choices are omitted in the
corresponding publication(s) which makes external implementations
difficult. In addition, the data used to showcase the proposed
methodologies are often private and actual data visualization is limited
to carefully selected snapshots for publication purposes which might not
be representative of algorithmic performance. Finally, many of these
analysis methods are patented and/or integrated into proprietary
commercial software packages which severely limits accessibility to
researchers.

As a corrective alternative, this project brings together leading
expertise in lung imaging research at Penn and UVa to develop, evaluate
and deploy under community support an open-source software toolkit
targeted for pulmonary imaging research. As principal developers of the
popular, open-source ANTs, ITK-SNAP and ITK packages, we have extensive
experience in the development of well-written software that has gained
much traction in the neuroscience community and propose to leverage and
enhance these advanced packages to make a similar impact in the
pulmonary community with this project. Specifically, we plan to provide
methods for core pulmonary image analysis tasks across multiple
modalities, many of which we have proposed in past work. These basic
tasks include pulmonary image registration, template building for
cross-sectional and longitudinal (i.e., respiratory cycle) analyses,
functional and structural lung image segmentation, and computation of
quantitative image indices as potential imaging biomarkers. In addition
to the software, we will provide scripts, documentation, and tutorial
materials consistent with open-science principles. Formally, this
proposal is defined by the following specific aims:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \textbf{Specific Aim 1:} \textbf{Develop a set of open-source software
  tools for CT, proton, and He-3 pulmonary computational analysis.}
  These open-source software tools will specifically target pulmonary
  image analysis and comprise core application functions such as
  inspiratory/expiratory registration for inferring pulmonary
  kinematics, ventilation-based segmentation, lung and lobe estimation,
  airway and vessel segmentation, nodule detection, and calculation of
  clinical indices for characterization of lung development and
  pathology. To support these software development efforts, CT and 1H
  MRI multi-atlas libraries ($n=30$ per library) per will be provided as
  open data complete with the corresponding lung, airway, vessel, and
  lobe segmentations according to modality. In addition, we will provide
  the corresponding optimal intensity/shape templates. Both sets of data
  will be provided with the corresponding scripts in order to reproduce
  the results. As developers of several leading open-source applications
  for image segmentation and registration, we know firsthand that the
  impact of a particular technological innovation greatly depends on the
  availability of an easily accessible software implementation. The
  proposed software framework will tie together all of the capabilities
  of the project's developed methodology in the form of programmable
  workflows and provide a seamless user experience through a full
  featured graphical user interface. Interactive functionality will
  extend beyond the ability to steer segmentation and registration
  pipelines to include tools for evaluation and visualization of
  processed results.
\item
  \textbf{Specific Aim 2:} \textbf{Validate and disseminate the
  developed ITK-Lung resources by leveraging use cases from a broad
  network of partner investigators representing the state-of-the-science
  in lung imaging research.} This aim will evaluate and refine the
  developed methodology within the real-world context of pulmonary
  research being carried out at various partner sites. We will
  disseminate the results of the evaluation through open-source
  distribution of the software, atlases and documentation, online user
  support, and conduct of hands-on training workshops.
\end{itemize}

\section{3 Research Strategy}\label{research-strategy}

\subsection{\textbf{3(a) Significance}}\label{a-significance}

\textbf{3(a.1) The importance of pulmonary image analysis tools for
research and clinical investigation.} The increased utilization of
imaging for both research and clinical purposes has furthered the demand
for quantitative image analysis techniques. The use of these
computational techniques is motivated by the need for less subjectivity
and more standardization in medical image interpretation, increased
speed and automation in diagnosis, and greater robustness and accuracy
for determining biological correlates with imaging findings. For
example, in the area of pharmaceutical development and testing, imaging
biomarkers are crucial. In order to determine fundamental study
parameters such as drug safety and effectiveness, quantitative
assessments derived from imaging measures must be objective and
reproducible {[}1{]} which is often difficult without computational aid
given the intra- and inter-reader variability in radiological practice
{[}2, 3{]}. Additionally, the exciting possibilities associated with
``big data'' and the potential for improvement in individualized,
evidence-based medicine has also increased the need for sophisticated
data transformation and machine learning techniques.

\textbf{3(a.2) Open-source as an essential attribute of high-impact
image analysis toolkits.} Well-vetted and publicly available software is
a significant benefit to targeted research communities. For example, the
neuroscience community has greatly benefited from highly evolved
software packages such as FreeSurfer {[}4{]}, the FMRIB Software Library
(FSL) {[}5{]}, the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) package
{[}6{]}, the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) package {[}7{]}, and
several others. Performing a pubmed query for any one of these softwares
every year for the past decade (cf Figure 1) illustrates the growing use
of such packages and the research studies that are produced as a result.
However, despite the absolute number of articles produced using such
software and the year-by-year usage increase, no such analogous set of
tools exist for pulmonary-specific research. In fact, in a recent review
of CT- and MRI-derived biomarkers for pulmonary clinical investigation,
the authorial consensus is that ``universally available image analysis
software'' is a major hinderance to more widespread usage of such
imaging biomarkers {[}8{]}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{stitched_files/figure-latex/pubmedQuery-1.pdf}
\caption{Number of articles per year which cite publicly available
neuroimaging analysis packages (specifically, FreeSurfer, AFNI, FSL, and
SPM). Although the benefits seem clear for the neuroscience community,
analogous efforts within the pulmonary community have yet to be
undertaken despite consensus amongst researchers and clinicians
regarding the utility of such offerings.}
\end{figure}

Medical image analysis libraries (e.g., the NIH-sponsored Insight
ToolKit) provide extensive algorithmic capabilities for a range of
generic image processing tasks. However, tailored software packages for
certain application domains (e.g., lung image analysis) are not
available despite the vast number of algorithms that have been proposed
in the literature. It is important to note that the goals of this
proposal would significantly support the National Library of Medicine's
own open-source directives in that all software would be developed using
the established Insight ToolKit's coding and testing standards with the
specific objective that all project code would be contributed for
inclusion in future versions of the Insight ToolKit as we have done in
the past. It should also be noted that open-source software, in general,
has documented benefits within the targeted communities for which it is
developed and supported. In addition to the increase in research output
illustrated earlier, open-source permits students and researchers to
learn specific computational techniques in a social environment {[}9{]}.
This, in turn, provides motivation for user-based support including
potential contributions such as bug fixes and feature additions.
Additional analyses have shown the tremendous cost savings that
open-source software yields {[}10{]}. Furthermore, open-source
development and distribution within a large, and well-invested community
(such as ITK) takes advantage of Linus's law, i.e., ``given enough
eyeballs, all bugs are shallow," for producing robust software.

\subsection{\textbf{3(b) Innovation}}\label{b-innovation}

\textbf{3(b.1) Open-source pulmonary imaging algorithmic innovation.}
Given the lack of open-source solutions for pulmonary image analysis,
this project would produce the first-of-its-kind processing and analytic
platform for performing such research. Similar to the brain-specific
algorithms provided in our ANTs toolkit, our proposal would include the
most essential algorithms for analyzing lung images from different
modalities including CT, 3He, and 1H MRI. \emph{Many algorithms have
been proposed in various technical venues but that which we propose
would provide well-vetted and easy-to-use implementations of specific
robust methodologies for pulmonary medical image analysis, many of which
have been developed by our group.} To facilitate the usage of these
algorithms, we will provide documentation including self-contained
online examples, tutorials, and hands-on training workshops.

\textbf{3(b.2) Use case studies with leading pulmonary research
scientists.} An additional innovative component we are proposing is the
inclusion of extensive use cases from leading pulmonary imaging research
scientists in various locations with different image acquisition
protocols, equipment, etc. to ensure quality and robustness of the
processed data. Additionally, such use cases involving other groups
would highlight existing deficiencies in algorithmic functionality in
our proposal which would then be remedied by additional development
efforts. These real-world use cases were solicited representing as
broadly as possible the requirements of the community as well as the
multiple modality and algorithmic variations which commonly occur.

We have partnered with leading pulmonary research groups who are
familiar with our work and who will provide study-specific imaging data
of various modalities which we will then process using the proposed
toolkit. These processed data will then be returned to the corresponding
providers with detailed instructions on reproducing these results in
their own labs. Software and tutorial materials drawn from these
experiences will be provided to the public for any interested researcher
to apply to their own data. Given the different image acquisition
sources, this strategy should also demonstrate the robustness of our
tools.

In addition to these collaborative efforts, our own analyses will also
be included. Any clinical findings of interest will be published in
traditional venues (e.g., Chest). In addition, we will provide all the
quantitative analysis scripts as a companion release for the paper
(e.g., see previous similar offerings from our group {[}11, 12{]}). Such
a comprehensive clinical investigation using these tools will not only
provide insight into the specifics of certain pulmonary pathologies but
will also provide a reproducible mechanism for using the tools created
in this project.

\subsection{\textbf{3(c) Research design}}\label{c-research-design}

\subsubsection{3(c.1) Preliminary data}\label{c.1-preliminary-data}

\textbf{3(c.1.1) Generic ANTs core tools for image analysis and
processing.} The Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) package is a
state-of-the-art, open-source software toolkit for image registration,
segmentation, and other core medical image analysis functionality.
Several core programs comprising portions of the proposed pulmonary
software framework have been created and made available within ANTs (and
either simultaneously or subsequently made available in ITK). However,
as mentioned earlier, these programs have more general application and
require pulmonary-specific tuning for the tasks targeted by this
proposal. The following list comprises several core software tools for
tuning, subsequent extensions, documentation, tutorial generation, and
the creation of easy-to-use bash scripts for large-scale processing of
pulmonary imaging data.

\textbf{ANTs image registration.} One of the most important
methodological developments in medical image analysis is the advent of
image registration techniques capable of accommodating the highly
complex inter-individual variations seen in human anatomy. Our team is
well-recognized for seminal contributions to the field that date back to
the original elastic matching method of Bajcsy and co-investigators
{[}13--15{]}. Our most recent work, embodied in the ANTs open-source,
cross-platform toolkit for multiple modality image processing, continues
to set the standard in the field. ANTs not only encodes the most
advanced results in registration research, notably the Symmetric
Normalization (SyN) algorithm for diffeomorphisms {[}16{]}, but also
packages these within a full featured platform that includes an
extensive library of similarity measures, transformation types, and
regularizers. Recently, a thorough comparison with the original SyN
algorithm was performed using a B-spline variant {[}11{]}. This
evaluation utilized multiple publicly available, annotated brain data
sets and demonstrated statistically significant improvement in label
overlap measures. As part of that study, we produced the scripts
\texttt{antsRegistrationSyN.sh} and \texttt{antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh}
which provide a simple interface to our normalization tools for
brain-specific normalization and are two of the most widely used scripts
in the ANTs toolkit. \emph{Similar to the developments that we are
proposing, these scripts were extensively modified to serve as a
follow-up entry into the EMPIRE10 lung registration challenge where
B-spline SyN performed better than its original counterpart on pulmonary
data {[}17{]}.}

\textbf{Multi-modal template generation.} Given the variability in
anatomical shape across populations and the lack of publicly available
atlases for specific organs, generating population- or subject-specific
optimal shape/intensity templates significantly enhances study potential
{[}18, 19{]}. First, an average template is estimated via a voxel-wise
mean of all the individual subject images. This estimate is iteratively
updated by registering each image to the current template, performing a
voxelwise average to create a new estimate, and then ``reshaping'' this
template based on the average inverse transformation which ``moves'' the
template estimate closer to the group mean. See Figure 2 for a
cohort-specific multi-modal brain template for females in the age range
50--60. This functionality has proven to be a vital component of the
ANTs toolkit for performing neuroimaging research (e.g., {[}12,
20--24{]}). \emph{Similarly, this functionality has also demonstrated
significant importance in pulmonary studies {[}25{]}.}

\textbf{Bayesian segmentation with spatial and MRF priors.} Early
statistically-based segmentation work appropriated NASA satellite image
processing software for classification of head tissues in 2-D MR images
{[}26{]}. Following this work, many researchers adopted statistical
methods for $n$-tissue anatomical brain segmentation. The
Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework is natural {[}27{]} given the
``missing data'' aspect of this problem. Core components of this type of
work include the explicit modeling of the tissue intensity values as
statistical distributions {[}28, 29{]} and the use of Markov Random
Field (MRF) modeling {[}30{]} for regularizing the classification
results {[}31{]}. Spatial prior probability maps of anatomical
structures of interest are also employed within this framework {[}32,
33{]}. Although this particular segmentation framework has significant
application in the neuroimaging domain, it is also relevant to other
domains including functional ventilation of the lung {[}34{]}.
\emph{However, despite the numerous developments which have been
proposed over the years within this area, there are an extremely limited
number of actual software implementations. This deficit inspired us to
create our own Bayesian segmentation framework {[}35{]} (denoted as
Atropos) which we have made publicly available within ANTs and has
proven highly effective in quantification of functional lung imaging
{[}34, 36--38{]}.}

\textbf{N4 bias correction.} Critical to quantitative processing of MRI
is the minimization of field inhomogeneity effects which produce
artificial low frequency intensity variation across the image.
Large-scale studies, such as ADNI, employ perhaps the most widely used
bias correction algorithm, N3 {[}39{]}, as part of their standard
protocol {[}40{]}. In {[}41{]} we introduced an improvement of N3,
denoted as ``N4'', which demonstrates a significant increase in
performance and convergence behavior on a variety of data. This
improvement is a result of an enhanced fitting routine (which includes
multi-resolution capabilities) and a modified optimization formulation.

\textbf{Joint label fusion for prior-based segmentation.} Joint label
fusion (JLF) is the current state-of-the-art for propagating expert
labelings from a reference atlas library onto new instances of unlabeled
data. Image registration is used to align the atlas library (images +
segmentations) to a common space. A statistical model is then used to
combine the ``guesses'' from all the normalized atlas labels to provide
a ``best guess'' estimate of the target labeling. Several such
algorithms have been developed and much effort has been devoted to
determining relative performance levels---see, for example, the recent
MICCAI 2012 Grand Challenge and Workshop on Multi-Atlas Labeling). The
joint fusion (JLF) algorithm of {[}42, 43{]} from our group is one of
the top performing JLF algorithms. JLF is capable of predicting
anatomical labels with accuracy that rivals expert anatomists {[}44{]}.
It has proven its effectiveness not only in cardiac data {[}45{]}, the
human brain {[}12{]}, and in multiple modality canine MRI {[}45{]}
\emph{but has also been successfully extended to the challening problem
of applying prior-based information to lung and lobe segmentation
{[}46{]}.}

\textbf{Spatially adaptive denoising.} Patch-based denoising is critical
for data ``cleaning'' prior to subsequent processing such as
segmentation or spatial normalization. ANTs implements a
state-of-the-art spatially adaptive version to denoising recently
proposed in {[}47{]}.

The previously described core tools, as well as several others, have
been part of ANTs and ITK development efforts for more than a decade.
The deficiency of publicly available tools within the neuroscience
community was the original motivation for the inception and continued
development of ANTs. As a result, our team is well-recognized for our
many open-source advancements including important contributions to the
field of image registration outlined earlier. Indeed, ANTs-based image
registration serves as the basis for the registration component of the
latest version of the National Library of Medicine Insight Toolkit (ITK)
programming library (\url{http://www.itk.org}) which is the leading
open-source platform for medical image analysis. \emph{The combination
of state-of-the-art algorithms and feature-rich flexibility has
translated to top-placed rankings in major independent evaluations for
core elements of the ANTs toolkit:}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  SyN was a top performer in a fairly recent large-scale brain
  normalization evaluation {[}48{]}.
\item
  SyN also competed in the Evaluation of Methods for Pulmonary Image
  REgistration 2010 (EMPIRE10) challenge {[}49{]} where it was the top
  performer for the benchmarks used to assess lung registration accuracy
  and biological plausibility of the inferred transform (i.e., boundary
  alignment, fissure alignment, landmark correspondence, and
  displacement field topology). The competition has continued to the
  present and SyN has remained the top-ranked algorithm.
\item
  The joint label fusion algorithm of {[}42, 50{]} (coupled with SyN)
  was top-ranked in the MICCAI 2012 challenge for labeled brain data
  {[}51{]} and in 2013 for labeled canine hind leg data {[}52{]}.
\item
  The multivariate template capabilities in ANTs were combined with
  random forests to win the Brain Tumor segmentation (BRATS) competition
  at MICCAI 2013 {[}19{]}.
\item
  A B-spline variant of the SyN algorithm {[}11{]} won the best paper
  award at the STACOM 2014 workshop for cardiac motion estimation
  {[}53{]}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3(c.1.2) Neuroimaging with ANTs as a model for the pulmonary
community.} ANTs takes advantage of the mature Insight ToolKit in
providing an optimal software framework for building scripts and
programs specifically for neuroimaging. For example, the following core
neuroimage processing algorithms have been made available through our
ANTs toolkit (complete with online self-contained examples with
developer-tuned parameters) and have been used extensively by the
community:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  brain normalization {[}54, 55{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/stnava/BasicBrainMapping}),
\item
  brain template generation {[}18{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/ntustison/TemplateBuildingExample}),
\item
  skull-stripping or brain extraction {[}12, 56{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/ntustison/antsBrainExtractionExample}),
\item
  prior-based brain tissue segmentation {[}54{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/ntustison/antsAtroposN4Example}),
\item
  cortical thickness estimation {[}12, 57{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/ntustison/antsCorticalThicknessExample}),
\item
  brain tumor segmentation {[}19{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/ntustison/ANTsAndArboles}), and
\item
  cortical labeling {[}42, 50{]}
  (\url{https://github.com/ntustison/MalfLabelingExample}).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figs/coreANtsToolsNeuro.png}
\caption{Core processing tools that have made the ANTs package one of
the most popular neuroimaging toolkits. Fundamental processing tasks
such as image registration, template generation, bias correction,
denoising, intensity-based segmentation, and joint label fusion are
extremely well-performing software components which have been utilized
for neuroimaging tasks such as brain extraction and cortical thickness
estimation. The target applications of these core tools have an
immediate analog for lung-specific tasks such as lung and lobe
segmentation.}
\end{figure}

All of these tools have been wrapped in easy-to-use, well-documented
shell scripts. For example, the ANTs cortical thickness pipeline, as
outlined in {[}12{]}, comprises four major steps: (1) bias correction,
(2) brain extraction, (3) $n$-tissue segmentation, and (4) cortical
thickness estimation. Each step requires its own set of ANTs tools with
appropriately tuned parameters. To maximize the utility of the pipeline
for the interested user, in {[}12{]} we provide all the necessary
programs (properly tuned) with a minimal set of input data required to
obtain good results for common data. The result is an easy-to-use script
that can be invoked by the programmer and non-programmer alike to obtain
the desired processed data which outperforms the current
state-of-the-art {[}12{]}. An example command call for the ANTs cortical
thickness pipeline is:

This approach to reducing the steep learning curve associated with many
processing pipelines has several benefits. Bash is an extremely common
command language that permits large-scale processing. Thus, running
several jobs on a cluster infrastructure is straightforward with this
approach. Such scripts are readable by the interested user who can glean
parameters as well as manually make changes.

\subsubsection{3(c.2) \textbf{Specific Aim 1:} To develop a set of
open-source software tools for CT, 1H, and 3He pulmonary computational
analysis}\label{c.2-specific-aim-1-to-develop-a-set-of-open-source-software-tools-for-ct-1h-and-3he-pulmonary-computational-analysis}

The envisioned open-science tool set for pulmonary image analysis
consists of software, processed data to illustrate the use of the
software, and the ability to visualize the processed data. With this
comprehensive offering, the goal of this proposal is to help the
pulmonary imaging research community on a much deeper level than simply
providing a set of programs. In order to facilitate engagement on the
part of the community, we are proposing a multi-prong offering with
ITK-Lung. The main componenent will be the core tool set described in
Sub-Aim 1a which would permit large-scale processing of multi-modal
pulmonary image data. To illustrate the use of the software, allow for
processing of other public and private data sets, and provide baseline
data for algorithmic comparison, we plan to release CT and 1H MRI
annotated atlas libraries, corresponding templates, and data-generating
scripts as described in Section Sum-Aim 1b. The third component will be
significant extensions to the well-known ITK-SNAP tool for enhanced
visualization of the results.

\textbf{3(c.2.1) Sub-Aim 1a will expand the ITK/ANTs open-source
libraries by implementing currently unavailable lung-specific
algorithms.} Analogous to the neuroimaging tasks described earlier,
several algorithmic categories exist for lung image analysis which, as
we have noted previously, do not exist in any comprehensive, publicly
available package. This is in spite of the fact that new algorithms for
lung image analysis are frequently reported in the literature. An
extensive survey concentrating on the years 1999--2004 is given in
{[}58{]} which covers computer-aided diagnosis of lung disease and lung
cancer in CT (i.e., detection and tracking of pulmonary nodules) and
provides an overview of the many relevant segmentation methods for
pulmonary structures. Although many algorithms existed at the time,
continued technical development has only increased the number of
available algorithms. However, despite the continued \emph{reporting} of
pulmonary image analysis algorithms, there is no corresponding increase
in algorithmic \emph{availability}. \emph{Additionally, a key problem in
the pulmonary image analysis community is that the lack of publicly
available tools translates directly into a lack of baseline performance
standards with which researchers can compare their own algorithms
{[}59{]}. This proposal constitutes a specific and overdue response to
this major deficiency in the field.}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics{Figs/coreANtsToolsLung.png}
\caption{Using ANTs core processing tools, our team has developed
several lung-specific extensions such as ventilation-based segmentation,
lung and lobe estimation, and multi-modal pulmonary template building.
Although each of these extensions requires significant additional
development and tuning, a robust and generic software foundation ensures
that these extensions are of high quality and are readily adapted to the
pulmonary image domain.}
\end{figure}

\emph{A primary assumption for this project is that, through extension
and continued development of ANTs and ITK functionality, we can make a
significant impact for the pulmonary imaging research community in both
basic science and clinical workflows by developing lung-specific
algorithms which are easy to use as we have done for the neuroimaging
community.} The following list comprises core functionality for CT
analysis that would be incorporated into ITK-Lung:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  whole lung differentiation from the chest wall (e.g., {[}60--63{]}),
\item
  bronchial structure extraction (e.g., {[}64, 65{]} and the many
  submissions to the recent Extraction of Airways from CT (ExACT)
  challenge of the 2nd International Workshop on Pulmonary Image
  Analysis {[}66{]}),
\item
  vasculature segmentation (e.g., {[}67, 68{]}),
\item
  lobe and/or fissure detection (e.g., {[}69, 70{]}),
\item
  feature extraction and classification (e.g., {[}71--73{]}), and
\item
  nodule detection (e.g., {[}74{]} and the many submissions to the
  Automatic Nodule Detection (ANODE09) challenge of the 2009 CAD
  Conference of SPIE Medical Imaging {[}75{]}).
\end{itemize}

Although this list is restricted to CT image analysis, inclusion of
additional techniques specific to other modalities has additional
benefit and are planned for this project (cf Table 1). Using ANTs core
tools, we have produced several lung-specific algorithms for core tasks
such as:

\textbf{Atlas-based lung segmentation.} Identification of anatomical
structure in MRI is often a crucial preprocessing step for
quantification of morphological features or ventilation information from
functional images. Quantitative regional analysis often requires the
identification of lung and lobar anatomy. Although much algorithmic
research for lung segmentation has been reported in the CT literature
{[}76{]}, co-opting such technologies is complicated by MRI-specific
issues such as RF coil inhomogeneity, presence and resolution of
structural detail, and the absence of a physically-based intensity
scaling.

We recently proposed a multi-atlas approach for automatically segmenting
the left and right lungs in 1H MRI {[}46{]}. Multi-atlas approaches to
segmentation have proven highly successful in neuroimaging {[}42, 50{]}
and these methods translate readily to the pulmonary domain. Whereas
many current strategies for lung image segmentation employ low-level
processing techniques based on encodable heuristics, consensus-based
strategies, in contrast, optimize the prior knowledge applied to a
specific segmentation problem (cf Figure 3). The evaluation of our
proposed method {[}46{]} demonstrated excellent performance with Jaccard
overlap measures for the left and right lungs being $0.966 \pm 0.018$
and $0.970 \pm 0.016$, respectively. Further work for this project
includes extension to CT datasets with a particular emphasis on
segmentation in the presence of lung pathology which will incorporate
the data from the multi-atlas CT library.

\input{algorithm_table.tex}

\textbf{Atlas-based lobe estimation.} For regional investigation of
certain lung pathologies and conditions, it is often useful to quantify
measurements of interest within more localized regions, such as the
lobes. However there is little (if any) usable information in 1H MRI for
image-based lobar segmentation which has led to alternative geometric
subdivisions which are ad hoc, non-anatomical, and do not adequately
address intra- and inter-subject correspondences. However, we can take
advantage of inter-subject similarities in lobar geometry to provide a
prior-based estimation of lobar divisions using a consensus labeling
approach (cf Figure 3).

To generate the lobe segmentation in a target 1H or CT lung image, we
first generate the binary whole lung mask using the whole lung
atlas-based estimation. We then register the set of CT lung masks which
have beeen expertly annotated to the target binary lung mask using the
B-spline SyN registration approach described earlier {[}11{]}.
Subsequently, we warp the set of CT lobe labels to the target image
using the CT mask-to-target mask transformation. This process will be
illustrated publicly as part of the project using the open-data
multi-atlas CT library created as part of the Sub-Aim 1b.

Since we have no intensity information inside the target lung mask and
CT atlas lung masks, we use a simply majority voting strategy to
generate the optimal labeling for the target image. Following the
majority voting, we remove any labelings outside the lung mask and
assign any unlabeled voxels with the label closest in distance to that
voxel. This methodology is more thoroughly described in {[}46{]} where
we showed that lobar overlap measures in 1H MRI were on par with
state-of-the-art CT methods where fissure information is actually
visible (left upper: $0.882 \pm 0.059$, left lower: $0.868 \pm 0.06$,
right upper: $0.852 \pm 0.067$, right middle: $0.657 \pm 0.130$, right
lower: $0.873 \pm 0.063$). We will extend this framework to pulmonary CT
in providing spatial prior probability maps augmented by image-specific
CT data features as fissures, airways, and blood vessels for
data-driven, subject-specific lobe segmentation {[}70{]}.

\textbf{Ventilation quantification.} Automated or semi-automated
approaches for classifying areas of varying degrees of ventilation are
of potential benefit for pulmonary functional analysis. In {[}34{]}, we
presented an automated algorithmic pipeline for ventilation-based
partitioning of the lungs in hyperpolarized 3He and 129Xe MRI. Without
ground truth data for evaluation, we used a consensus labeling approach
{[}77{]} to simultaneously estimate the true segmentation from given
``raters'' which included the segmentation from our automated approach
and the manual tracings of three trained individuals. In terms of
combined specificity and sensitivity, our automated algorithm
demonstrated superior performance with the added benefit of being
reproducible and less time-consuming. Since the initial development, we
have continued to improve this segmentation pipeline by incorporating an
iterative bias-correction/segmentation estimation scheme. An additional
component that improves results is an ANTs-based implementation of the
patch-based denoising protocol described in {[}47{]}.

\textbf{Multi-modal lung template construction.} Although the template
construction algorithm described in {[}18{]} is, as pointed out earlier,
frequently applied to T1-weighted brain data, it is sufficiently generic
such that it can potentially be applied to pulmonary data. Also, new
innovations in diffeomorphic registration technology has led to a
Symmetric Normalization B-spline variant which will be extended and
refined to provide accurate normalizations {[}11{]} for pulmonary data
{[}17{]}.

\textbf{Feature indices.} Imaging biomarkers for characterizing
emphysema in CT have have been well researched, although there are ample
opportunities to refine these methods as well as to introduce more
advanced approaches. Examples of the latter include texture analysis for
identifying the centrilobular and groundglass opacities and fractal and
connectivity approaches to differentiate centrilobular from panlobular
emphysema. The indices for CT image analysis can roughly be divided into
those that characterize the pulmonary parenchyma: volumetric tissue
(e.g., {[}78, 79{]}), distribution of low attenuation areas (LAA) (e.g.,
{[}80, 81{]}), cooccurrence and run-length matrix features (e.g., {[}71,
82{]}), attenuation statistics (e.g., {[}83, 84{]}), deformation
measures (e.g., {[}85, 86{]}), and stochastic fractal dimension features
(e.g., {[}71, 84{]}); and those that characterize the airways (e.g.,
{[}87--89{]}). The former are important for subjects with an
emphysematous component of disease, whereas the latter are important for
subjects with a bronchitic component of disease. \emph{An important
component of this proposal is that many of these measurements can also
be directly applied to discriminative analysis using 3He MRI for a
variety of lung diseases.} These indices can also be studied not only at
any particular single time point, but also for changes with time. The
addition of quantitative morphologic measurements of the airways
provides an assessment of the contribution of airway changes to chronic
lung disease.

\input{ct_table.tex}

Table 2 provides an overview of these types of discriminative
measurements, many of which can be used for CT and 3He lung assessment.
We have already implemented many of these image features and have
contributed the result of our work to the Insight Toolkit (e.g., {[}90,
91{]}).

\textbf{Airway and vessel segmentation.} In describing the quantitative
CT lung indices, it was pointed out that lung airway morphology has been
previously utilized as a biomarker for disease characterization.
Additionally, there are other potential uses motivating the inclusion of
airway segmentation in any pulmonary image analysis toolkit. In an
evaluation of 15 airway segmentation algorithms {[}92{]} for the
Extraction of Airways from CT challenge held in 2009, a total of 40 CT
scans from 8 sites divided into testing and training data sets and
manually annotated by medical student observers. Sensitivity and
specifity criteria were used to assess relative performance levels with
the top 2 performers were the algorithms of {[}93{]} and {[}94{]} with
the latter being one of the more conservative algorithms and the former
being more prone to false positives. Our plan is to provide an
implementation of {[}93{]} and then augment this functionality with some
of our previous work {[}95{]} for removing leakage path candidates.

ITK has extensive functionality for segmentation of vessel-like
structures. Much of that work has been incorporated into comprehensive
packages such as the analysis and visualization Vessel Modeling ToolKit
(\url{http://www.vmtk.org}). For this project we will focus development
and refinement of these ITK capabilities for CT lung application in
segmenting the pulmonary vasculature.

\textbf{Nodule detection.} CT is used for screening of lung cancers
(i.e., pulmonary nodules) which currently requires human intervention
for the laborious and tedius task of manual scanning. Automated
detection methods could potentially save significant time and effort
which has inspired much research literature on the topic including
several commercial systems and specialized visualization hardware for
facilitating detection. In 2009, a nodule detection competition was held
for comparing performance of individual algorithms as well as their
combinations {[}75{]}. This competition included entries from both
academic institutions as well as a system from Philips (although, to our
knowledge, none are available for public use). The best performing
algorithm of that competition was based on the work presented in
{[}96{]} where a k-nearest neighbor classification employing local image
features is built from a large training data set. We plan to implement
this method potentially with some modifications based on our experience
with a more recent challenge dealing with segmentation of pathology
{[}19{]}.

\textbf{3(c.2.2) Sub-Aim 1b will provide two annotated multi-atlas
libraries, one for CT and one for 1H MRI. The corresponding group
templates will also be provided with the scripts to produce the results
using ITK-Lung.} As a complement to the open-source software provided in
Sub-Aim 1a, we will generate atlas libraries for both CT and 1H MRI
acquisitions. Both libraries will consist of $n=30$ different subjects
and will be annotated according to modality. The CT atlas library will
include lung, lobe, airway, and vessel segmentations. The 1H MRI atlas
library will include left/right lung segmentations. With the annotated
data we will provide the scripts and documentation to reproduce the
ITK-Lung results. Additionally, two group templates {[}18{]} for the two
atlas libraries will be included as part of these open data sets.

\textbf{3(c.2.3) Sub-Aim 1c will extend current functionality of
ITK-SNAP for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the results
produced by ITK-Lung.} Project investigator Paul Yushkevich leads the
development of ITK-SNAP {[}97{]}, a multi-platform open-source tool for
interactive user-guided medical image segmentation and data
visualization. ITK-SNAP provides an effective combination of
semi-automatic segmentation functionality based on active contours
{[}98, 99{]} and manual delineation functionality, put together into a
compact and easy-to-learn graphical user interface. ITK-SNAP supports
segmentation of multiple volumetric imaging modalities, species, and
anatomical regions, without bias to any particular problem domain.
Compared to other, larger open-source image analysis tools, ITK-SNAP
design focuses specifically on the problem of image segmentation, and
extraneous or unrelated features are kept to a minimum. The design also
emphasizes interaction and ease of use, with the bulk of the development
effort dedicated to the user interface. ITK-SNAP has thousands of users
(there have been over 2000 downloads per month in the last year), and
our 2006 paper on ITK-SNAP {[}97{]} has been cited over 1400 times
(Google Scholar) in the context of various biomedical domains. In recent
years, ITK-SNAP development and maintenance were funded by grant 5R01
EB014346, and under this grant, powerful new functionality for
registration was developed. ITK-SNAP will be used in this project for
manual labeling of the proposed CT lung atlases; it is already used for
this purpose by many investigators. \emph{Most crucially, we believe
that our track record with ITK-SNAP as well as ANTs demonstrates our
team's commitment to producing high-quality research software and making
it accessible to the wider research community through open-source
practices, intuitive user interfaces, and outreach efforts. These
strengths of the team will be applied to the software and data developed
in the course of this project.}

Several features will be added to ITK-SNAP to enhance visualization and
quantitation for the registration and segmentation results of the
lung-specific algorithms developed in the Sub-Aim 1a and the data
generated in Sub-Aim 1b. Users will be able to edit and annotate these
segmentations, modify transforms, and extract quantities both globally
and regionally. Transforms will be modifiable via manual annotations
(clicking corresponding landmarks and/or tracing curves) or by directly
modifying transform parameters. Finally, quantitative parameters, such
as volumes and strain tensors, will be available through the ITK-SNAP
interface. \emph{We believe that the proposed enhancements to the
software will be extremely useful to the general imaging research
community and not just those investigators targeted in this project.
Thus, the impact of this work will be both immediate and broad for
pulmonary-driven science and research.}

\textbf{3(c.2.4) Software engineering.} Both ANTs and ITK-SNAP
development, based on a solid foundation provided by the Insight
Toolkit, utilizes open-source software engineering best practices, such
as the use of Git version management software for collaborative
development and easy branching and merging; use of a centralized
repository (SourceForge) for code, executable and data sharing; use of
the CMake/CTest/CDash suite for cross-platform development, testing and
automatic builds. Virtual machines with different versions of Windows,
MacOS and Linux operating systems generate nightly builds and execute
test code, uploading a binary to the central SourceForge repository.
ANTs and ITK-SNAP are documented through video and text tutorials,
housed online on dedicated websites {[}100, 101{]}. A similar
infrastructure will be developed for the software resources proposed in
Aim 1.

\subsubsection{3(c.3) \textbf{Specific Aim 2.} Validate and disseminate
the developed resources by leveraging use cases from a broad network of
partner investigators representing the state-of-the-science in lung
imaging
research}\label{c.3-specific-aim-2.-validate-and-disseminate-the-developed-resources-by-leveraging-use-cases-from-a-broad-network-of-partner-investigators-representing-the-state-of-the-science-in-lung-imaging-research}

This aim builds on the project team's long and successful track record
of collaboration with the general user community. In particular, the
investigator-driven studies presented below are carefully selected both
for their capacity to fully exercise the developed tools and to provide
a comprehensive representation of the various processing and analysis
tasks of interest to the community.

\textbf{3(c.3.1) Novel imaging biomarkers for COPD.} Co-investigator
\textbf{Mike Shim} and his group have been actively developing 3D
hyperpolarized xenon-129 dissolved-phase MRI (HXe MRI) as a sensitive
biomarker for accurately characterizing phenotypes and severity of COPD.
This protocol permits regional mapping of ventilation and gas uptake by
tissue and blood in human lungs with single breath hold {[}102--104{]}.
This project plans to establish connectivity between these advanced HXe
MRI imaging signatures and important clinical outcomes of COPD to
establish HXe MRI as a novel clinical diagnostic tool. They anticipate
that this new biomarker tool will naturally lead to deeper mechanistic
understanding of COPD at the molecular-physiologic and clinical levels
and support identification of potential pathophysiologic derrangement
associated with COPD and a new method to accurately predict therapeutic
response to current standard COPD therapies. Refinement of HXe MRI as a
pulmonary diagnostic tool is anticipated to encourage development of new
clinical interventions. HXe MRI is the first non-invasive imaging
technique that can provide regional information about three unique
characteristics of lung function: lung ventilation, size and
connectedness of distal alveolar airspaces, and HXe gas transfer from
airspaces to red blood cells. HXe MRI, therefore, is anticipated to
overcome the limitation of pulmonary function testing (PFT) which only
provides physiologic parameters of the lung as a whole unit, and High
Resolution CT (HRCT) which only provides anatomic characterization
without physiologic information. They anticipate that the HXe MRI will
detect pathologic changes present in COPD patients with high sensitivity
and specificity previously unattainable by current clinical standard
(PFT and HRCT). Moreover, HXe MRI can determine whether gas transfer
abnormalities are due to impaired ventilation or reduced gas-exchange,
and provide new insights into pathogenesis of COPD in individual
patients.

Crucial to the success of establishing the utility of HXe MRI as a
sensitive biomarker for accurately characterizing COPD phenotypes is
quantification of imaging signatures in an automated and robust fashion.
Identification of ventilation dead space ($V_D$) for correlation with
GOLD classification will utilize the previously described
ventilation-based segmentation approach {[}34{]}. In order to determine
lobar values of HXe MRI, they will utilize the recently proposed lobar
estimation algorithm {[}46{]} in both proton MRI and CT.

\textbf{3(c.3.2) Hyperpolarized gas imaging in children with asthma.}
Advances in rapid image sequencing methods have facilitated the
acquisition of high-quality hyperpolarized gas MR images in pre-school
children {[}105{]}. Furthermore improvements in image processing and
signal intensity analysis can accurately measure lung volume
compartments {[}34{]}. Co-investigators \textbf{Gerry Teague} and
\textbf{Talissa Altes} are applying these innovations in children with
asthma to study whether the lung defect volume \% as measured by
hyperpolarized lung MRI correlates with a range of clinical features.
They hypothesize the ventilation defect volume \% would be higher in
children with severe asthma, and correlate not only with the degree of
airflow limitation, but indicators of asthma control, treatment, and
inflammation.

Precise measurement of ventilation volumes by hyperpolarized noble gas
MRI not only has the potential to resolve the spatial and temporal
characteristics of gas distribution in children with asthma, but could
also expand clinically relevant information in regards to asthma
severity and its features. In the past simple computer-assisted systems
{[}106{]} or hand counts of visual defects were used to estimate the
ventilation defect volume {[}107{]}. Development of more advanced
techniques (in terms of acquisition and analysis) will facilitate rapid
conversion of complex hyperpolarized gas signal data into volume
compartments for clinical applications.

Absolutely crucial to the advanced techniques being developed by
Dr.~Teague and his group are sophisticated image analysis tools like the
ones being proposed. For example, the ventilation-based segmentation
described in {[}34{]} is being used to determine volumetric compartments
based on lung function. Additional ``cleaning'' necessary for these data
include denoising techniques {[}47{]} implemented and made available in
ANTs. Lobe estimation will be possible by refining the techniques
originally described in {[}46{]}.

\textbf{3(c.3.3) Characterization of COPDGene cohort by hyperpolarized
gas (HP) MRI.} Co-investigator \textbf{Rahim Rizi} is leading a study of
lung function and structure in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD) using HP MRI. Once inhaled, this gas can tell the researcher how
well specific lung regions replace the air during the normal breathing
cycle (Fractional Ventilation, FV), how much oxygen is in the airspaces
(Oxygen Tension, PAO2), and if the normal spongy tissue structure has
been compromised in lung disease (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient).
Subjects will include those at risk for lung disease, and those
displaying mild and moderate COPD. Subjects will be mostly drawn from
the well-characterized population currently enrolled in the COPDGene
trial (10,000 subjects overall) such that standard clinical images (End
Inspiration and End Expiration CT) and Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs),
as well as genetic sequencing, will already have been done. Each subject
will be imaged twice during the course of the five-year study, and the
regional features will be compared between the CT and MRI images to the
genetic markers, changes in clinical measurements, and patient quality
of life.

The proposed study will generate non-invasive biomarkers of COPD
progression derived from minute, short-term alterations in lung function
and microstructure. Due to the excellent safety profile of MRI, these
metrics will be appropriate for use in novel, flexible study designs.
Perhaps most importantly, this research will enhance understanding of
the natural history of COPD. In doing so, it will provide a vital
supplement to ongoing efforts to identify COPD subtypes by adding
substantial physiologic detail to descriptions of this disease. The
overall goals of the study experiments are:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  to develop imaging markers that better identify early COPD
\item
  to develop tests that predict health deterioration due to COPD
\item
  to determine if specific patterns of disease progression are
  associated with genetic markers identified in the larger COPDGene
  study, and
\item
  to determine if disease progression is in part caused by excessive
  stretch in regions of the lung next to blocked-off areas unable to
  inflate normally.
\end{itemize}

More than 200 million people suffer from COPD worldwide. Yet effectively
assessing the progression of this increasingly prevalent disease and
monitoring its response to treatment remain problematic. Hyperpolarized
gas MRI can help rectify these issues by providing sensitive
measurements of lung physiology and microstructure, but its adoption by
clinicians and investigators has been slow. In contrast, CT-based
methods for measuring emphysema, airway wall thickening, and expiratory
air trapping have become common in COPD clinical studies. There are
several reasons for this: CT is more accessible, its images possess
excellent spatial resolution, and quantification of these images is
currently superior. However, most CT-based parameters have only an
indirect relation to physiology, and the modality exposes patients to
ionizing radiation. Both of these shortcomings can be addressed by HP
gas MRI. Consequently, the study seeks to more fully exploit the
clinical potential of HP gas MRI by optimizing and testing parameters
for the regional assessment of COPD patients and symptomatic smokers.

A novel multi-breath HP MRI technique allows for the simultaneous
measurement of fractional ventilation (FV), regional partial pressure of
oxygen (PAO2), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Obtaining all
three parameters in a single scan reduces the necessary amount of
imaging gas while increasing accuracy by correcting artifacts associated
with collateral ventilation and the slow filling of parenchyma in
diseased lungs. Each of these metrics allows for the investigation of a
vital aspect of lung disease progression and their comparison with the
current CT-scans and standard of care will help to more clearly
understand different features and phenotypes of COPD.

The proposed image analysis software will be central to the successful
conduct of the following tasks necessary to establish the goals of this
study:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Registration of the multibreath/multislice Gas MRI images of the
  whole-lung consisting of a minimum of seven time points
\item
  Registration and analysis of inspiratory and expiratory CT for airway
  changes to assess airway collapsibility and remodeling and other CT
  markers
\item
  Registration and analysis of inspiratory and expiratory CT with MRI to
  study the similarities and differences of the two modalities in
  phenotyping the COPD population
\item
  Registration of the follow-up MRI and CT images (two years) to
  determine if disease progression is in part caused by excessive
  stretch in regions of the lung next to blocked-off areas unable to
  inflate normally (based on the baseline MRI and CT)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3(c.3.4) Advanced image analysis of CT for early diagnosis and
prognosis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) in lung transplant
patients.} Co-investigators \textbf{Eduardo Barbosa} and \textbf{Warren
Gefter} are conducting a retrospective study of more than 300 lung
transplant patients to advance the early diagnosis of BOS. Lung
transplantation is an established treatment for end-stage, irreversible
pulmonary disease, particularly due to COPD and interstitial lung
disease (ILD). While continued improvements in surgical techniques and
immunosuppressive medications have reduced the complication rates and
increased short-term survival after the procedure, chronic allograft
rejection due to bronchiolitis obliterans (a fibrous obliterative
disease of bronchioles representing the histological hallmark of chronic
rejection and resulting in obstructive pulmonary physiology) remains the
major cause of morbidity and mortality after six months following
transplantation. Bronchiolitis obliterans currently represents the
greatest limitation to long-term survival after lung transplantation.
While the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans is a pathologic one and
therefore requires invasive biopsy, the distribution of disease is
patchy, with focal areas of abnormality surrounded by normal lung, and
consequently even biopsies may fail to demonstrate the diagnosis. For
these reasons, the International Society for Heart and Lung
Transplantation has recommended using declining spirometry, termed
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), as a surrogate marker of
chronic allograft rejection. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of BOS
is suspected based on an unexplained decline in lung function (measured
by PFT, of greater than 20\% of baseline FEV1) and worsening cough and
dyspnea, in the absence of other explanations such as pulmonary
infection or congestive heart failure. MDCT plays an important role by
demonstrating low attenuation areas representing air trapping,
particularly on expiratory images, which correlate with the presence of
bronchiolitis obliterans. Prior studies reported limited sensitivity for
the early diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans; however these utilized
semi-quantitative or qualitative assessment of air trapping in
non-volumetric data sets. This study aims to assess whether automated
imaging analysis can detect early BOS prior to development of clinically
apparent disease.

PFT is the current reference standard for diagnosis of BOS, however, by
the time PFT abnormalities beyond the threshold of BOS diagnosis ensue,
the disease is already manifest and is not reversible with existing
therapies. It is conceivable that sophisticated analysis of CT,
including quantitative attenuation masks in inspiratory and expiratory
datasets, image registration and texture based feature extraction may
allow earlier detection of BOS in the preclinical phase, potentially
generating surrogate biomarkers for drug trials and earlier
prognostication.

Application of the proposed advanced software tools and algorithms in
this project for quantitative analysis of CT images in lung
transplantation patients will be crucial to enable computation of an
array of first and second order statistics which would capture not only
attenuation maps but also regional deformation and texture based
features. In combination, this may allow multiparametric statistical
modeling that may predict which patients will develop BOS before PFT
abnormalities beyond the diagnostic threshold ensue. Such tools will be
extended to other diffuse lung diseases, potentially generating new
biomarkers for diagnosis, prognostication and therapeutic trials.

\textbf{3(c.3.5) Comparison of automated multi-modality registration
methodologies to manual registration for lung CT bronchial morphologic
changes and hyperpolarized helium MR ventilation defects in asthma
patients: Can automation speed the work flow for combining structure and
function using airways measures from CT and ventilation measures from HP
gas MRI.} Our collaborators \textbf{Sean Fain} and \textbf{Mark
Schiebler}, \textbf{University of Wisconsin}, are part of the SARP
(Severe Asthma Research Program) team developing imaging biomarkers of
asthma severity for predicting asthma exacerbation. The approach of
finding airway abnormalities that correlate with ventilation defects is
viable only with the availability of robust image registration across
the two modalities. Furthermore, translation to the clinic will require
standardized implementations across sites, and the project's open-source
platform is ideal for this purpose.

\textbf{3(c.3.6) Deep functional phenotyping of COPD.} Our collaborator
\textbf{Hans-Ulrich Kauczor}, \textbf{University Medical Center
Heidelberg}, is leading the COSYCONET (German COPD and Systemic
Consequences--Comorbidities Network) study, the world's first
prospective multicenter trial comparing proton MRI and CT imaging for
characterizing COPD, with the latter modality serving as the reference
standard. Automated image registration and segmentation will play a
vital role in defining the quantitative CT (air trapping, airway
collapsibility and remodeling, and pulmonary blood volume and vascular
pruning) and MR (air trapping, perfusion volume defects, and hypoxic
vasoconstriction) imaging biomarkers that form the basis for the study.

Longitudinal imaging follow-up in COPD and lung cancer Our collaborator
Joon-Beom Seo, Asan Medical Center, directs the imaging component of the
Korean Obstructive Lung Disease (KOLD) cohort study, which has collected
over 1000 COPD cases from 17 participating centers with repeated imaging
since 2005. He also leads a national lung cancer radiomics project that
has accrued 800 cases to date. In both studies, robust image
registration is essential to tracking changes over time, and
segmentation is an additional requirement to support automated lesion
delineation for the cancer project.

\textbf{3(c.3.7) Advanced image processing pipelines for MR image-guided
pulmonary therapy decisions and support.} Our collaborator \textbf{Grace
Parraga}, \textbf{University of Western Ontario}, has been at the
forefront of MR imaging of lung structure and function since 2005. A
major challenge hampering widespread translation of current pulmonary
imaging advances is the lack of precision in their interpretation,
thereby complicating the planning and guiding of targeted therapies. The
project's software tools will enable the development of robust analysis
pipelines for the translation of in vivo imaging biomarkers openly
across platforms and centers. This work, carried out in collaboration
with industrial partners, will support patient phenotyping and
stratification to therapy as well as measurement of longitudinal changes
and response to therapy.

\textbf{3(c.3.8) Functional MR imaging of the lungs using hyperpolarized
and inert gases.} Our collaborator, \textbf{Mitchell Albert},
\textbf{Thunder Bay Regional Research Institute}, has been advancing the
use of inert fluorinated gases that can be breathed continuously in
order to measure indicators of wash-in, wash-out and air trapping with
dynamic imaging protocols. To compute the wash-in and wash-out time
constants on a pixelwise basis, access to accurate and reliable image
registration tools will be essential.

\textbf{3(c.3.9) Multimodality imaging studies of pulmonary diseases.}
Our collaborator, \textbf{Edwin van Beek}, \textbf{University of
Edinburgh}, has been conducting various multimodality studies, including
the evaluation of pulmonary fibrosis using both gadolinium-enhanced MRI
and contrast-enhanced CT perfusion imaging, and the assessment of lung
nodules using PET-CT and CT perfusion imaging. These relatively new
techniques would benefit from quantitative analysis of contrast
enhancement, and advanced image registration and segmentation
capabilities will both be necessary toward this end.

More details about the research, data, and advances enabled by the
proposed software tools for each of the studies above can be found in
the corresponding letter of support. \emph{The nature and diversity of
the imaging data collected for these studies will be a stringent test of
the ease of use, interactivity, and flexibility of the developed
processing and analysis software resources in this project. Moreover,
the studies will yield valuable additions to the portfolio of use cases
that serve as primary reference and instructional material.}

\textbf{3(c.3.10) Sub-Aim 2a will disseminate the results of the project
through open-source publication of the code, annotated processed data,
online user support, and conduct of hands-on training workshops.} ITK is
the leading open-source development system for medical image analysis,
and to demonstrate its endorsement of this project's value to the field,
ITK will lend its infrastructure to provide long-term hosting services
for the developed resources as well as incorporate ITK-Lung training
into its educational programs that are offered in conjunction with major
scientific (e.g., annual International Conference on Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention) and user forums (e.g.,
hackathons); see Yoo letter of support. Further leveraging of ITK
support will include formalized advisory input from its core development
team (of which the project team is a member), and access to and
promotion within its extensive outreach program. Complete dissemination
details can be found in the Resource Sharing Plan.

\textbf{3(c.4) Risks and alternatives} While the proposed infrastructure
is complex and integrates multiple cutting-edge technologies, we do not
anticipate significant problems in its development and consider the risk
of failure of the project to be very low. Our optimism is based on the
extensive preliminary work that has been performed over a significant
period of time to successfully demonstrate feasibility of every aspect
of the project. Given the level of expertise and experience of our
interdisciplinary team and the well-defined scope of the imaging and
software engineering problems, we are highly confident in a successful
outcome.

\textbf{3(c.5) Timeline} \textbf{Aim 1:} Software development will take
place in Years 1-5, with Year 1 focused on refactoring of existing
ANTs-based code and integration with ITK; Year 2 focused on
incorporation of new methods to support expanded functionality beyond
core algorithms; Year 3 focused on GUI implementation; Year 4 focused on
releasing a fully functional system; and Year 5 focused on incremental
improvements based on Aim 2 studies. \textbf{Aim 2:} A preliminary
version of the software will be deployed at evaluation sites toward the
end of Year 2, and testing will run through Year 4. Documentation and
dissemination efforts will take place throughout the course of the
project.
