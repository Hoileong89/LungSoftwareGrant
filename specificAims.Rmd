# Specific Aims

The development and proliferation of quantitative image analysis methods have accelerated
research efforts and are having an increasingly significant impact in modern clinical
practice.  Although the research utility of these techniques has been amply demonstrated in
determining longitudinal and groupwise trends, they are also becoming increasingly relevant
in the clinical setting in providing biomarkers for aiding patient diagnoses, monitoring
disease progression, and determining treatment outcomes.  Increases in the capabilities
and accessibility of computational facilities and a corresponding sophistication in computational
algorithms have only made such practices more commonplace.

One of the most significant hurdles in adopting more quantitative clinical practices and
exploring additional novel research pathways is the availability of accurate, robust, and
easy-to-use image analysis tools.  Historically, the research and clinical communities (and their overlap)
have significantly benefited from the development and proliferation of imaging-related
analysis packages, particularly those softwares which have been tailored for
specific application domains.  Although several such established packages exist for
neuroimaging research (e.g., FSL, FreeSurfer, AFNI, SPM), no such package exists for
pulmonary imaging analysis.  The primary goal of this proposal is to develop
a robust, open-source image analysis toolkit and dissemination platform
 specifically targeted at the pulmonary research community.

Although methodological research is continually being presented at conferences and
published in various venues, the unfortunate reality is that much of this work exists
strictly in “advertisement” form.  Oftentimes the underlying code is unavailable to other
researchers or is implemented in a limited manner (i.e., strictly as proof-of-concept
software).  Frequently, crucial parameter choices are omitted in the corresponding
publication(s) which makes external implementations difficult.  In addition, the data used
to showcase the proposed methodologies are often private and actual data visualization is
limited to carefully selected snapshots for publication (i.e., advertisement) purposes
which might not be representative of algorithmic performance.  Finally, many of these
analysis methods are patented and/or integrated into proprietary commercial software
packages which severely limits accessibility to researchers.

As a corrective alternative, this proposal will provide an open-source software toolkit
targeted for pulmonary research.  As principal developers of the popular, open-source ANTs
(Advanced Normalization Tools) package, we have extensive experience in the development of
well-written software that has gained much traction in the neuroscience community and propose
to make a similar impact in the pulmonary community with this proposal.  Specifically,
we plan to provide methods for core pulmonary image analysis tasks across multiple modalities, many
of which we have proposed previously in past publications.  These basic tasks include pulmonary image registration,
template building for cross-sectional and longitudinal (i.e., respiratory cycle) analyses,
functional and structural lung image segmentation, and computation of quantitative image
indices as potential imaging biomarkers.  In addition to the software, we will
provide additional data, documentation, and tutorial materials consistent with open-science
principles.   Formally, this proposal is defined by the following specific aims:

* __Specific Aim 1:__  __Develop a set of open-source software tools for CT, proton, and He-3
pulmonary computational analysis.__  These open-source software tools will specifically
target pulmonary image analysis and comprise core application functions such as
inspiratory/expiratory registration for inferring pulmonary kinematics, ventilation-based segmentation,
lung and lobe estimation, airway segmentation, and calculation of clinical indices for
characterization of lung development and pathology.  To maximize usability, much (if not all)
of the actual code will be developed and distributed within the  Insight Toolkit of the
National Library of Medicine.
* __Specific Aim 2:__  __Provide multiple sets of multi-modal annotated lung data (CT, proton,
and He3) for unrestricted public use.__  In addition to the public unavailability of the
algorithms used to produce the results discussed in certain publications, the input and output
data is also typically not available.  Such availability would be invaluable to other
researchers in the community for appropriation for their own purposes including algorithmic
performance assessment and running the proposed prior-based methods requiring annotated
input data.
* __Specific Aim 3:__  __Evaluate and disseminate the developed resources by leveraging
input data from multiple partner investigators.__  This aim will evaluate and refine the
developed methodology within the real-world context of pulmonary research being carried out at
various partner sites \textcolor{red}{(e.g., University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania, \ldots,
need to add others)}.
We will disseminate the results of the project through open-source distribution of the software,
data and write-ups, online user support, and conduct of hands-on training workshops.
