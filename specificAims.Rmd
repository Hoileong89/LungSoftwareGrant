# Specific Aims

Medical research significantly benefits from the development and proliferation of imaging-
related analysis packages, particularly those softwares which have been tailored for
specific application domains.  Although several such established packages exist for the
neuroimaging community (e.g., FSL, FreeSurfer, AFNI, SPM), no such package exists for the
pulmonary imaging research community.  The primary goal of this proposal is to develop and
provide a dissemination platform for a robust, open-source image analysis toolkit with
annotated data specifically targeted at the pulmonary research community.

Although methodological research is continually being presented at conferences and
published in various venues, the unfortunate reality is that much of this work exists
strictly in “advertisement” form.  Oftentimes the underlying code is unavailable to other
researchers or is implemented in a limited manner (i.e., strictly as proof-of-concept
software).  Frequently crucial parameter choices are omitted in the corresponding
publication(s) which makes outside implementations difficult.  Additionally, the data used
to showcase the proposed methodology are often private and actual data visualization is
limited to carefully selected snapshots for publication (i.e., advertisement) purposes
which might not be representative of algorithmic performance.

As a potential corrective, this proposal will provide an open-source software toolkit for
core pulmonary image analysis tasks across multiple modalities which we proposed in recent
publications.  These basic tasks include image registration, template building for
cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, and functional and structural lung image
segmentation.  In addition to the software, we will provide both the input and output
data as open-source not only so that other users can it to reproduce our results, but it
will also allow researchers to use it in their studies.

As principal developers of the popular, open-source ANTs (Advanced Normalization Tools)
package, we have extensive experience in the development of well-written software that has
gained much traction in the neuroscience community.  We have also participated in several
image analysis competitions for a variety of applications (neuro, pulmonary, and cardiac)
and data scaling and believe that this will also contribute to our success in
accomplishing the goals of this application as defined by the following specific aims:

* __Specific Aim 1.__  To develop a set of open-source software tools for CT, proton, and He-3
pulmonary computational analysis.
* __Specific Aim 2.__  To provide multiple sets of multi-modal annotated lung data (CT, proton,
and He3) for public use.
* ___Specific Aim 3.__  Perhaps instead of Aim 2, we can include analysis of one of Mike’s
comprehensive data sets (multi-modal CT, proton & Xe), publish the results, as well as
provide all the scripts (using ANTsR?) for the user to re-run the analysis on the user
side._
