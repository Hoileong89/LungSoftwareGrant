# Specific Aims

Medical research significantly benefits from the development and proliferation of imaging-related
analysis packages, particularly those softwares which have been tailored for
specific application domains.  Although several such established packages exist for
*neuroimaging* research (e.g., FSL, FreeSurfer, AFNI, SPM), no such package exists for
pulmonary imaging analysis.  The primary goal of this proposal is to develop
a robust, open-source image analysis toolkit and dissemination platform, along with annotated
data, specifically targeted at the pulmonary research community.

Although methodological research is continually being presented at conferences and
published in various venues, the unfortunate reality is that much of this work exists
strictly in “advertisement” form.  Oftentimes the underlying code is unavailable to other
researchers or is implemented in a limited manner (i.e., strictly as proof-of-concept
software).  Frequently, crucial parameter choices are omitted in the corresponding
publication(s) which makes external implementations difficult.  In addition, the data used
to showcase the proposed methodologies are often private and actual data visualization is
limited to carefully selected snapshots for publication (i.e., advertisement) purposes
which might not be representative of algorithmic performance.  Finally, many of these
analysis methods are patented and/or integrated into proprietary commercial software
packages which severely limits accessibility to researchers.

As a corrective alternative, this proposal will provide an open-source software toolkit for
core pulmonary image analysis tasks across multiple modalities, many of which we have proposed
previously in past publications.  These basic tasks include pulmonary image registration,
template building for cross-sectional and longitudinal (i.e., respiratory cycle) analyses,
functional and structural lung image segmentation, and computation of quantitative image
indices as potential imaging biomarkers.  In addition to the software, we will
provide both the input and output data consistent with open-science principles not only so that other users can it to
reproduce our results, but it will also allow researchers to use it in an unrestricted manner
in their own studies.   Formally, this proposal is defined by the following specific aims:

* __Specific Aim 1:__  __Develop a set of open-source software tools for CT, proton, and He-3
pulmonary computational analysis.__  These open-source software tools will specifically
target pulmonary image analysis and comprise core application functions such as
inspiratory/expiratory registration for inferring pulmonary kinematics, ventilation-based segmentation,
lung and lobe estimation, airway segmentation, and calculation of clinical indices for
characterization of lung development and pathology.  To maximize usability, much (if not all)
of the actual code will be developed and distributed within the  Insight Toolkit of the
National Library of Medicine.
* __Specific Aim 2:__  __Provide multiple sets of multi-modal annotated lung data (CT, proton,
and He3) for unrestricted public use.__  In addition to the public unavailability of the
algorithms used to produce the results discussed in certain publications, the input and output
data is also typically not available.  Such availability would be invaluable to other
researchers in the community for appropriation for their own purposes including algorithmic
performance assessment and running the proposed prior-based methods requiring annotated
input data.
* __Specific Aim 3:__  __Evaluate and disseminate multiple complete studies with input data
from multiple investigators to showcase the utility of the tools and data provided with this
proposal.__  In order to maximize the utility of the proposed pulmonary image analysis
framework, our proposal also includes making available the input data from multiple
researchers (with their permission) involved in a variety of pulmonary research questions and
the output data produced by the framework.  Among other purposes, this contribution will provide
complete, concrete examples demonstrating usage of the proposed contribution.

As principal developers of the popular, open-source ANTs (Advanced Normalization Tools)
package, we have extensive experience in the development of well-written software that has
gained much traction in the neuroscience community.  We have also participated in several
image analysis competitions for a variety of applications (neuro, pulmonary, and cardiac)
and data scaling and believe that this will also contribute to our success in
accomplishing the goals of this application.
