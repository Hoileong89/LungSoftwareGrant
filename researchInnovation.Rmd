__3(b.1) Open-source pulmonary algorithmic innovation.__
Given the lack of open-source solutions for pulmonary image analysis,
the proposal goals would produce an innovative platform for performing such research.
Similar to the brain-specific algorithms provided in our ANTs toolkit, our novel
and useful proposal would include the most essential algorithms for analyzing lung
images from different modalities including CT, 3He, and proton MRI.
Many algorithms have been proposed in various technical venues but that which we propose
would provide well-vetted and easy-to-use implementations of specific robust methodologies
for pulmonary medical image analysis, many of which have been developed by our group.
To facilitate the usage of these algorithms, we will provide several self-contained
online examples.

__3(b.2) Use case studies with leading pulmonary research scientists.__
An additional innovative component we are proposing is the inclusion of extensive use
cases from leading pulmonary research scientists in various locations with different
image acquisition protocols, equipment, etc. to ensure quality and robustness of the
processed data.  These real-world use cases were solicited representing as broadly as
possible the requirements of the community as well as
the multiple modality and algorithmic variations which commonly occur.

Specifically, we have
asked several scientists and researchers who are familiar with our work to provide imaging data
of various modalities which we will then process using the proposed toolkit.  These processed
data will then be returned to the corresponding providers with detailed instructions
on reproducing these results in their own labs.  Software and tutorial materials drawn from
these experiences will be provided to the public for any interested researcher to
apply to their own data.  Given the different image acquisition sources,
this strategy should also demonstrate the robustness of our tools.

Included in these analyses will be analyses of our own data.  Any clinical findings
of interest will be published in traditional venues (e.g., Chest).  In addition, we will
provide all image
data and the quantitative analysis scripts as a companion release to accompany the paper
(e.g., see previous similar offerings from our group [@Tustison:2013ac;@Tustison:2014ab]).
 Such a comprehensive clinical
investigation using these tools will not only provide insight into the specifics of certain
pulmonary pathologies
but will also provide a reproducible mechanism for using the tools created with this proposal.
