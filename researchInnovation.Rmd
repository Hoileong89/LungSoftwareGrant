__3(b.1) Open-source pulmonary imaging algorithmic innovation.__
Given the lack of open-source solutions for pulmonary image analysis,
this project would produce the first-of-its-kind processing and analytic  platform for performing
such research.
Similar to the brain-specific algorithms provided in our ANTs toolkit [@ANTsWebsite], our
 project would include \textcolor{red}{several} essential algorithms for analyzing lung
images from different modalities, including CT, 3He, and 1H MRI.
_Many algorithms have been proposed in various technical venues, \textcolor{red}{(mostly
as textual descriptions without accompanying software,)}
but that which we propose
would provide well-vetted and easy-to-use implementations of specific robust methodologies
for pulmonary medical image analysis, many of which have been developed by our group._
To facilitate the usage of these algorithms, we will provide documentation including
self-contained online examples, tutorials, and hands-on training workshops.
\textcolor{red}{We recognize that the methodological depth of the field is extensive
and implementing even a small portion of the total number of algorithms would be
extremely daunting.  However, limiting algorithmic implementation to those with which we are
familiar and have provided good performance for our clinical collaborations will provide
an extremely beneficial package with significant implications for the community.}

__3(b.2) Use case studies with leading pulmonary research scientists.__
An additional innovative component of the project is the inclusion of extensive use
cases from leading pulmonary \textcolor{red}{imaging research scientists at our home institutions
as well as other external collabotors with regression testing performed} using different
image acquisition protocols, equipment, etc. to ensure quality and robustness of the
\textcolor{red}{software and} processed data.  Such use cases involving other groups
would highlight existing deficiencies in framework functionality
which would then be addressed.
These real-world use cases were solicited representing as broadly as
possible the requirements of the community as well as
the multiple modality and algorithmic variations which commonly occur.

\textcolor{red}{Our institutional collaborators will comprise the group of primary beta testers.
Processed data will be returned to the corresponding providers with detailed instructions
on reproducing these results in their own labs. Other external collaborators who will also
provide feedback based on their interaction with the platform.}
\textcolor{red}{Tutorial materials, data, and example scripts} drawn from
these experiences will be provided to the public for any interested researcher to
apply to their own data.  Given the different image acquisition sources,
this strategy should also demonstrate the robustness of our tools.
Any clinical findings
of interest will be published in traditional venues (e.g., Chest).  In addition, we will
provide all the quantitative analysis scripts as a companion release for the paper
(e.g., see previous similar offerings from our group [@Tustison:2013ac;@Tustison:2014ab]).
 Such a comprehensive clinical research
investigation using these tools will not only provide insight into the specifics of certain
pulmonary pathologies
but will also offer a reproducible mechanism for using the tools created in this project.
