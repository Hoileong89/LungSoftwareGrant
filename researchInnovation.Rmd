__3(b.1) Open-source pulmonary imaging algorithmic innovation.__
Given the lack of open-source solutions for multi-modality pulmonary image analysis,
this project would produce the first-of-its-kind processing and analytic  platform for performing
such research.
Similar to the brain-specific algorithms provided in our ANTs
\textcolor{red}{(Advanced Normalization Tools)} toolkit [@ANTsWebsite], our
 project would include \textcolor{red}{several} essential algorithms for analyzing lung
images from different modalities, including CT, PET, 3He, and 1H MRI.
_A large number of algorithms have been proposed in various technical venues,
\textcolor{red}{but these are mostly in the form of
textual descriptions without accompanying software.}
\textcolor{red}{In contrast, we will provide} well-vetted and easy-to-use
implementations of specific robust methodologies
for pulmonary image analysis, many of which have been developed by our group._
To facilitate the usage of these algorithms, we will provide documentation including
self-contained online examples, tutorials, and hands-on training workshops.
\textcolor{red}{We recognize that the methodological depth of the field is extensive
and implementing even a small portion of the total number of algorithms would be
prohibitive.}  \textcolor{red}{However, the algorithmic implementations provided through this
project have been discussed in the literature and have delivered consistently
excellent performance in our
clinical collaborations.  The availability of such implementations will offer a
unique clinical utility to the community as well as a performance benchmark
and baseline platform for future
algorithm developers.}

__3(b.2) Use case studies with leading pulmonary research scientists.__
\textcolor{red}{Another} innovative component of the project is the inclusion of an extensive set of use
cases from leading pulmonary \textcolor{red}{research groups with regression testing performed} using different
image acquisition protocols, equipment, etc. to ensure quality and robustness of the
\textcolor{red}{software and} processed data.
\textcolor{red}{The use of separate, independent testing sites will increase the value of the
tools produced by ensuring that their success is not specific to the particular
source of data.  This will increase the generality of the developed resources and
thus ease dissemination to the wider community. Toward this end, the}
real-world use cases were solicited representing as broadly as
possible the requirements of the community as well as
the multiple modality and algorithmic variations which commonly occur.
\textcolor{red}{Tutorial materials, data, and example scripts} drawn from
these studies will be provided to the public for any interested researcher to
apply to their own data.
Any clinical findings
of interest will be published in traditional venues (e.g., Chest).  In addition, we will
provide all the quantitative analysis scripts as a companion release for the paper
(e.g., see previous similar offerings from our group [@Tustison:2013ac;@Tustison:2014ab]).
\textcolor{red}{A clinically-based evaluation of these tools will provide insight into the specifics
of certain pulmonary pathologies
and also offer a reproducible mechanism for using the tools created in this project.}
