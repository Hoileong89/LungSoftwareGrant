# Point-by-point response

1. No details regarding hardware and data
    * (Page 2, Resume and summary of discussion) "little details about hardware and data"
    * (Page 3, Overall impact) "some method descriptions and discussion of issues beyond software are lacking (sic)"
    * (Page 4, Innovation:  weaknesses) "Little is said about the hardware and data throughput requirements (and benchmarking of computation time)."
    * (Page 5, Approach:  weaknesses) "Some method descriptions are too brief... several \"trivial\"
      (well-known?) space wasters could be reduced, with more method/approach discussion then given: 1) pg. 115 – Table 1; 2) pg. 117 – Table 2; 3)
       pg. 113 – code fragment for an example command."
    * (Page 5, Approach:  weaknesses) "[Gui processing] is given minimal attention...A little more could be said on this issue and on the hardware/memory/graphics requirements for running the software."
    * (Page 7, Approach:  weaknesses) "Details on their specific methods for the segmentation and other functions are not given"
    * Response:   Where did the hardware discussion come from?  This is not a hardware proposal
2. PET imaging
    * (Page 2, Resume and summary of discussion) "missing opportunity to include PET imaging"
    * (Page 3, Overall impact) "PET imaging is notably missing"
    * (Page 4, Approach:  weaknesses) "Yet, positron emission tomography (PET) – not discussed in this proposal (c.3.12 noted)"
    * (Page 9, Overall impact) "PET imaging is not considered "
    * Response:  I think I can get PET data from LIDC.  However, the problem is that what software should we write (SUV?).
3. Lung motion
    * (Page 2, Resume and summary of discussion) "overall dynamic nature of the lung environment"
    * (Page 4, Innovation:  weaknesses) "Given the dynamic nature of the lung environment (organ motion, complex large
    organs, vasculature dynamics [contrast, perfusion], etc.) and the considerable heterogeneity
    of applications and scanner configurations/modalities used in this domain, it is a trifle
    difficult to settle on a good basis for a general-usage package. The proposal necessarily must
    settle on an idiosyncratic selection of methods in a vast domain."
    * (Page 9, Overall impact) "The evolving of motion management techniques in pulmonary
    imaging may limit the use of such open source software"
    * (Page 10, Approach:  weaknesses) "The challenge of respiratory motion in pulmonary
    imaging for developing such tool kit is not thoroughly discussed and addressed."
    * Response:
        * We won the EMPIRE10 challenge.
        * We won the best paper for the cardiac motion estimation challenge.
5. Too many external collaborators
    * (Page 3, Overall impact) "it also appears to be a distraction that could weaken the project’s depth at the expense of breadth."
    * (Page 5, Approach:  weaknesses) "involves too many external collaborative groups for one project...
      a bit of redundancy in the recruited groups. It seems they’d be better off (and less stressed) if
      they cut the number of collaborators in half (?)."
    * Response:  Easy fix---we limit to UVa and Penn data as alpha testers
6. General usage problems
    * (Page 3, Significance:  weaknesses ) "a case can be made that it is difficult to devise a general-usage open-source package
that would actually be useful in the proposal’s chosen domain."  Could also go with 3. as they write
"Unlike the brain domain which often relies on static images for a non-moving organ, the lungs and nearby anatomy (heart, etc.) experience much motion"
    * Response:  ANTs has proven useful in the neuro domain.  Note that it is not just us that think this.  Eric Hoffman also thinks this (cite paper).
    * (Page 5, Approach:  weaknesses) "It is not a package for clinicians, nor will it
    necessarily enable finished turnkey applications that clinicians can readily use."
    * (Page 7, Approach:  strengths)  "Many of the feature indices (Table 2) noted already
    exist in generic form in Brain packages, etc., and thus it should already exist for
    pulmonary images. Why is the research funding for such needed?"
    * Response:
9.  Word choice
    * (Page 5, Approach:  weaknesses) "I would be careful to state that the chosen methods are the \"best/optimal,\""
    * Response:  Easy fix.
10.  Reduce scope
    * (Page 5, Approach:  weaknesses) Vessel segmentation:  "nothing is said about vessel segmentation."
    * (Page 5, Approach:  weaknesses) Nodule detection:  "This again is an extremely complex problem"
    * Response:  Reduce methods along with external collaborators
14.  Lack of novelty
    * (Page 6, Overall impact) "This is a needed, though not novel, ... given the large amount
    of thoracic image analysis already in existence and the vague plan to incorporate it in
    order to avoid redundant research."
    * (Page 7, Innovation:  weaknesses) "Why now is it expected that with the proposed
    research that there will be \"an immediate and broad impact on the field\"?"
    * (Page 7, Innovation:  weaknesses) "there are some publically available image analysis
    software tools"
    * (Page 9, Overall impact) "Innovation is quite low".
    * Response:  There are no publicly available tools:
        * The LIDC and RIDER projects are databases with minimal support for software.  In fact
          the software available is only to facilitate annotation and data conversion.  It
          does not perform any of the useful
15.  Naivety of investigators
    * (Page 7, Significance:  weaknesses) "The success is highly unlikely given the naiveness
    of the investigators regarding the complexity of the task, and that while they appear to
    be aware of the years of CAD radiomics research in the pulmonary imaging field, recreating
    it themselves is not trivial. On one hand, the simple features that were used in brain and
    the associated software modules already exist. On the other hand, the complexity of
    processing the thorax is quite different from the brain."
    * (Page 9, Investigators:  strengths) "The Principal Investigator has extensive
    experience in neuroimaging but not much in pulmonary imaging."
    * Response:  Respectfully disagree.  A separate group, Eric Hoffman has been designing lung
      software for decades and he is aware of the need.
16. Limited lung application
    * (Page 7, Approach:  strengths)  "however, [software tools] are mainly in the brain"...
     "however, large dataset verification is necessary."
      * Response:  We can use Eduardos data.  However, there is no clinical outcome or result.
