### 3(a.1) The importance of pulmonary image analysis tools for research and clinical investigation

The increased utilization of imaging for both research and clinical purposes has  furthered
the demand for quantitative image analysis techniques.  The use of these computational
techniques are motivated by the need for less subjectivity and more standardization in
medical image interpretation, increased speed and automation in diagnosis, and greater
robustness and accuracy for determining biological correlates with imaging findings.
For example, in the area of pharmaceutical development and testing, imaging biomarkers are crucial.
In order to determine fundamental study parameters such as drug safety
and effectiveness, quantitative assessments derived from imaging measures must be objective
and reproducible [@Wang:2010aa] which is often difficult without computational aid given the intra-
and inter-reader variability in radiological practice [@Zhao:2013aa;@McErlean:2013aa].
Additionally, the exciting possibilities associated with "big data" and the potential
for improvement in individualized, evidence-based medicine has also increased the need
for sophisticated data transformation and machine learning techniques.

Well-vetted and publicly available software is a significant benefit
to targeted research communities.  For example, the neuroscience community has greatly
benefited from highly evolved software packages such as FreeSurfer [@Fischl:2012aa], the FMRIB Software
Library (FSL) [@Jenkinson:2012aa], the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) package [@Cox:2012aa], and the
Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) package [@Ashburner:2012aa].  Performing a pubmed query for any one of
these softwares every year for the past decade (cf Figure 1) illustrates the growing use of
such packages and the research studies that are produced as a result.  However, despite the
absolute number of articles produced using such software and the year-by-year usage increase,
no such analogous set of tools exist for pulmonary-specific research.  In fact, in a recent
review of CT- and MRI-derived biomarkers for pulmonary clinical investigation, the authorial
consensus is that ``universally available image analysis software'' is a major hinderance
to more widespread usage of such imaging biomarkers [@Hoffman:2015aa].

Although the benefits seem clear for the neuroscience community, analogous efforts within the pulmonary community have yet to be undertaken despite consensus amongst researchers and clinicians regarding the utility of such offerings." }

  fetch <- EUtilsGet( res )
  abstracts <- AbstractText( fetch )
  numberOfAbstractsPerYear[i] <- length( abstracts )
  }

plotDataFrame <- data.frame( Year = as.factor( years ), NumberOfAbstracts = numberOfAbstractsPerYear )
ggplot( data = plotDataFrame, aes( x = Year, y = NumberOfAbstracts, fill = NumberOfAbstracts ) ) +
          geom_bar( stat = "identity" ) +
          scale_fill_gradient( low = "#01256e", high = "#6d0e0e" ) +
          ylab( "Number of articles" ) +
          xlab( "Publication year" ) +
          theme( legend.position = "none" )

Medical image analysis libraries (e.g., the NIH-sponsored Insight ToolKit) provide extensive algorithmic
capabilities for a range of generic image processing tasks.  However,
tailored software packages for certain application domains (e.g., lung image analysis) are not
available despite the vast number of algorithms that have been proposed in the literature.
Note that the goals of this proposal would
significantly support the National Library of Medicine’s own open-source directives in that
all software would be developed using the established Insight ToolKit’s coding and testing
standards with the eventual idea that much (if not all) of the actual code would be contributed
for inclusion in future versions of the Insight ToolKit as we have done in the past.
It should also be noted that open-source software, in general, has documented benefits
within the targeted communities for which it is developed and supported.  In addition to
the increase in research output illustrated earlier, open-source permits students and
researchers to learn specific computational techniques in a social environment [@Yunwen:2003aa].
This, in turn, provides motivation for user-based support including potential contributions
such as bug fixes and feature additions.  Additional analyses have shown the tremendous
cost savings that open-source software yields [@Rothwell:2008aa].  Furthermore, it should
be highlighted that open-source development and distribution within a large, and well-invested
community (such as ITK) takes advantage of Linus's law, i.e., ``given enough eyeballs, all bugs are
shallow," for producing robust software.
