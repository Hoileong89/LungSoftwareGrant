### 3(c.2) __Specific Aim 1:__   To develop a set of open-source software tools for CT, 1H, and 3He pulmonary computational analysis

The envisioned open-science tool set for pulmonary image analysis consists of software,
processed data to illustrate the use of the software, and the ability to visualize the
processed data.  With this comprehensive offering, the goal of this proposal is to help
the pulmonary imaging research community on a much deeper level than simply providing a
set of programs.  In order to facilitate engagement on the part of the community, we are
proposing a multi-prong offering with ITK-Lung.  The main componenent will be the
core tool set described in Sub-Aim 1a which would permit large-scale processing of multi-modal
pulmonary image data.  To illustrate the use of the software, allow for processing of other
public and private data sets, and provide baseline data for algorithmic comparison, we
plan to release CT and 1H MRI annotated atlas libraries, corresponding templates, and
data-generating scripts as described in Section Sum-Aim 1b.  The third component will be
significant extensions to the well-known ITK-SNAP tool for enhanced visualization of
the results.

__3(c.2.1) Sub-Aim 1a will expand the ITK/ANTs open-source libraries by implementing currently
unavailable lung-specific algorithms.__
Analogous to the neuroimaging tasks described earlier, several algorithmic categories exist for lung image
analysis which, as we have
noted previously, do not exist in any comprehensive, publicly available package.  This is
in spite of the fact that new algorithms for lung image analysis are frequently reported
in the literature.   An extensive survey concentrating on the years 1999–2004 is given in
[@Sluimer:2006aa] which
covers computer-aided diagnosis of lung disease and lung cancer in CT (i.e., detection and
tracking of
pulmonary nodules) and provides an overview of the many relevant segmentation methods for
pulmonary structures. Although many algorithms existed at the time, continued technical
development has only increased the number of available algorithms.    However, despite the
continued _reporting_ of pulmonary image analysis algorithms, there is no corresponding
increase in algorithmic _availability_.  _Additionally, a key problem in the pulmonary
image analysis community is that the lack of publicly available tools translates directly
into a lack of baseline performance standards with which researchers can compare their
own algorithms [@Tustison:2013aa].  This proposal constitutes a specific and overdue
response to this major deficiency in the field._

![Using ANTs core processing tools, our team has developed several lung-specific extensions
such as ventilation-based segmentation, lung and lobe estimation, and
multi-modal pulmonary template building.  Although each of these extensions requires significant
additional development and tuning, a robust and generic software foundation ensures that
these extensions are of high quality and are readily adapted to the pulmonary image
domain.](Figs/coreANtsToolsLung.png)

_A primary assumption for this project is that, through extension and continued development
of ANTs and ITK functionality, we can make a significant impact for the pulmonary imaging
research community in both basic science and clinical workflows by developing lung-specific
algorithms which are easy to use as we have done for the neuroimaging community._  The
following list comprises core functionality for CT analysis that would be incorporated into ITK-Lung:

* whole lung differentiation from the chest wall (e.g., [@De-Nunzio:2011aa;@Prasad:2008aa;@Wang:2009aa;@Rikxoort:2009aa]),
* bronchial structure extraction (e.g., [@Zheng:2007aa;@Nakamura:2008aa] and the many submissions to the recent Extraction of Airways from CT (ExACT) challenge of the 2nd International Workshop on Pulmonary Image Analysis [@Lo:2009aa]),
* vasculature segmentation (e.g., [@Agam:2005aa;@Korfiatis:2011aa]),
* lobe and/or fissure detection (e.g., [@Qi:2014aa;@Doel:2015aa]),
* feature extraction and classification (e.g., [@Uppaluri:1999aa;@Rosas:2011aa;@DeBoer:2014aa]), and
* nodule detection (e.g., [@Messay:2010aa] and the many submissions to the Automatic Nodule Detection (ANODE09) challenge of the 2009 CAD Conference of SPIE Medical Imaging [@Ginneken:2010aa]).

Although this list is restricted to CT image analysis, inclusion of additional techniques
specific to other modalities has additional benefit and are planned for
this project (cf Table 1).  Using ANTs core tools, we have produced several
lung-specific algorithms for core tasks such as:

__Atlas-based lung segmentation.__  Identification of anatomical structure in MRI is often a
crucial preprocessing step for quantification of morphological features or ventilation
information from functional images.  Quantitative regional analysis often requires the
identification of lung and lobar anatomy.  Although much algorithmic research for lung
segmentation has been
reported in the CT literature [@Rikxoort:2013aa], co-opting such technologies is complicated by
MRI-specific issues such as RF coil inhomogeneity, presence and resolution of structural detail, and
the absence of a physically-based intensity scaling.

We recently proposed a multi-atlas approach for automatically segmenting the left and right
lungs in 1H MRI [@Tustison:2015aa].  Multi-atlas approaches to segmentation have proven highly
successful in neuroimaging [@Wang:2012aa;@Wang:2013aa] and these methods translate readily to
the pulmonary domain.  Whereas many current strategies for lung image segmentation employ
low-level processing techniques based on encodable heuristics, consensus-based strategies,
in contrast, optimize the prior knowledge applied to a specific segmentation problem (cf Figure 3).
The evaluation of our proposed method [@Tustison:2015aa] demonstrated excellent performance
with Jaccard overlap measures for the left and right lungs being $0.966 \pm 0.018$ and
$0.970 \pm 0.016$, respectively.  Further work for this project includes extension to
CT datasets with a particular emphasis on segmentation in the presence of lung pathology
which will incorporate the data from the multi-atlas CT library.

<!--
![Sample lung and lobe estimation results in both 1H MRI and CT using our
atlas-based strategy.  (Left) Lung segmentation and lobe estimation results for the given
1H MRI.  Although lobe estimation is dependent solely on the warped atlases, we are
able to obtain accurate estimates of lobes which are useful for more regional analysis
and provide a more intuitive and universal subdivision of the lungs than previous partitioning
schemes.  (Right) The utility of this method extends to CT where the integrity of lobar anatomical
markers (such as the lack of fissures illustrated by the red arrows) have been compromised due to
disease.](Figs/lungEstimation.png)
-->

__Atlas-based lobe estimation.__  For regional investigation of certain lung pathologies and
conditions, it is often useful to quantify measurements of interest within more localized
regions, such as the lobes.  However there is little (if any) usable information in 1H
MRI for image-based lobar segmentation which has led to alternative geometric subdivisions
which are ad hoc, non-anatomical, and do not adequately address intra- and inter-subject
correspondences.  However, we can take advantage of
inter-subject similarities in lobar geometry to provide a prior-based estimation of
lobar divisions using a consensus labeling approach (cf Figure 3).

To generate the lobe segmentation in a target 1H or CT lung image, we first generate the
binary whole lung mask using the whole lung atlas-based estimation.  We
then register the set of CT lung masks which have beeen expertly annotated to the target
binary lung mask using the B-spline
SyN registration approach described earlier [@Tustison:2013ac].
 Subsequently, we warp the set of CT lobe labels to the target image using
the CT mask-to-target mask transformation.  This process will be illustrated publicly as part
of the project using the open-data multi-atlas CT library created as part of the Sub-Aim 1b.

Since we have no intensity information inside
the target lung mask and CT atlas lung masks, we use a simply majority voting strategy to
generate the optimal labeling for the target image.  Following the majority voting, we
remove any labelings outside the lung mask and assign any unlabeled voxels with the label
closest in distance to that voxel.  This methodology is more thoroughly described in
[@Tustison:2015aa] where we showed that lobar overlap measures in 1H MRI were on par
with state-of-the-art CT methods where fissure information is actually visible
(left upper: $0.882 \pm 0.059$, left lower: $0.868 \pm 0.06$, right upper: $0.852 \pm 0.067$,
right middle: $0.657 \pm 0.130$, right lower: $0.873 \pm 0.063$).  We will extend this
framework to pulmonary CT in providing
spatial prior probability maps
augmented by image-specific CT data features as fissures, airways, and blood vessels
for data-driven, subject-specific lobe segmentation
[@Doel:2015aa].


__Ventilation quantification.__
Automated or semi-automated approaches for classifying areas of varying degrees of ventilation
are of potential benefit for pulmonary functional analysis.  In [@Tustison:2011aa], we presented
an automated algorithmic pipeline for ventilation-based partitioning of the lungs in hyperpolarized
3He and 129Xe MRI.  Without ground truth data for evaluation, we used a consensus labeling approach [@Warfield:2004aa]
to simultaneously estimate the true segmentation from given ``raters''
which included the segmentation from our automated approach and the manual tracings of three trained
individuals.  In terms of combined specificity and sensitivity, our automated algorithm
demonstrated superior performance with the added benefit of being reproducible and less
time-consuming.  Since the initial development, we have continued to improve this segmentation pipeline by
incorporating an iterative bias-correction/segmentation estimation scheme.   An additional
component that improves results is an ANTs-based implementation of the patch-based denoising protocol
described in [@Manjon:2010aa].

<!--

for hyperpolarized 3He MRI.  These data were taken from a current study looking at the
implications in ventilation pre- and post-albuterol intake including an additional
acquisition at some delay period following the post-albuterol imaging.  The
ventilation-based segmentation is as follows:  red = no ventilation, green = poorly
ventilated, blue = normally ventilated, and yellow = well-ventilated.
Note the improvement in both the qualitative assessment of the ventilation map (top) and the corresponding
segmentation time course (bottom) followed by an approximate return to pre-albuterol
conditions following the delay period.](Figs/prePostAlbuterol.png)
-->

<!--
Crucial to the development of ITK-Lung will be domain-specific experience.  For example,
although ANTs performance in brain
registration has been independently evaluated and found to be of relatively high quality
[@Klein:2009aa], tailoring our registration tool to achieve top performance levels for the
EMPIRE10 challenge (Evaluation of Methods
for Pulmonary Image REgistration 2010) required significant empirically-based tuning.  In
addition, new innovations in diffeomorphic registration technology has led to a Symmetric
Normalization B-spline variant which has demonstrated accurate normalizations
[@Tustison:2013ac]
and transformations which are particularly well-suited for pulmonary data [@Tustison:2012aa].
-->

__Multi-modal lung template construction.__
Although the template construction algorithm described in [@Avants:2010aa] is,
as pointed out earlier, frequently applied to T1-weighted brain data,
it is sufficiently generic such that it can potentially be applied
to pulmonary data.  Also, new innovations in diffeomorphic registration technology has led to a Symmetric
Normalization B-spline variant which will be extended and refined to provide accurate
normalizations [@Tustison:2013ac] for pulmonary data [@Tustison:2012aa].

<!--
In Figure 4, we illustrate the major processing components of a recent study
analyzing local changes based on a pulmonary treatment plan [@Tustison:2013ad].  This
study employed several of the tools we are proposing for inclusion in the specified aims.
The first major component is the construction of a single-subject 3He/1H MRI
template for all five imaging time points.  This step generates the statistical coordinate
system for the voxelwise regression analysis of the normalized intensities to determine
correlation with expected treatment effects.

![Voxelwise regression analysis to determine image-based response to treatment.  First,
a multi-modal, single-subject template is created to bring all time point images to
the same coordinate system.  4-D segmentation is performed on the longitudinal time series
of 3-D image volumes.  Treatment
effects are expected to follow the simplified treatment hypothesis illustrated with the
dashed blue line in the plot on the right.  To explore how the longitudinal change in expected
ventilation follows this treatment hypothesis with image data, we smooth the aligned expected
ventilation maps (to account for potential voxelwise misalignments) and then quantify how the
voxelwise intensities regress with the simplified treatment hypothesis.  This quantification
is visualized using the correlation maps depicted in the template space (top right).  Positive
correlations with the expected treatment effect are rendered in orange whereas negative correlations
are rendered in blue.](Figs/longitudinalStudy.png)

__Feature indices.__  Imaging biomarkers for characterizing emphysema in CT have
have been well researched, although there are ample opportunities to refine these methods
as well as to introduce more advanced approaches.  Examples of the latter include texture
analysis for identifying the centrilobular and groundglass opacities and fractal and
connectivity approaches to differentiate centrilobular from panlobular emphysema. The
indices for CT image analysis can roughly be divided into those that characterize the
pulmonary parenchyma:
  volumetric tissue (e.g., [@Coxson:1999aa;@Perez:2005aa]),
   distribution of low attenuation areas (LAA) (e.g., [@Coxson:2005aa;@Stolk:2007aa]),
   cooccurrence and run-length matrix features (e.g., [@Uppaluri:1999aa;@Xu:2006aa]),
   attenuation statistics (e.g., [@Gevenois:1996aa;@Hoffman:2006aa]),
   deformation measures (e.g., [@Gee:2003aa;@Sundaram:2005aa]), and
   stochastic fractal dimension features (e.g., [@Uppaluri:1999aa;@Hoffman:2006aa]);
and those that characterize the airways (e.g., [@Aykac:2003aa;@Park:1998aa;@Ederle:2003aa]).
The former are important
for subjects with an emphysematous component of disease, whereas the latter are important
for subjects with a bronchitic component of disease. _An important component of this
proposal is that many of these measurements can also be directly applied to discriminative
analysis using 3He MRI for a variety of lung diseases._
These indices can also be studied not only at any particular single time point, but also
for changes with time. The addition of quantitative morphologic measurements of the airways
provides an assessment of the contribution of airway changes to chronic lung disease.

\input{ct_table.tex}

Table 2 provides an overview of these types of
discriminative measurements, many of which can be used for CT and 3He lung assessment.
We have already implemented many of these image features and have contributed the result of our work to
the Insight Toolkit (e.g., [@Tustison:2008aa;@Tustison:2009aa]).

<!--
As an
open-source repository for medical image analysis algorithms, contribution of our work
to the ITK allows researchers full access to the latest image analysis algorithms in
addition to avoiding research redundancy. It is also beneficial in that the entire ITK
community participates in the vetting of the software library.
-->

__Airway and vessel segmentation.__  In describing the quantitative CT lung indices,
it was pointed out that lung airway morphology has been previously utilized as a biomarker
for disease characterization.  Additionally, there are other potential uses motivating
the inclusion of airway segmentation in any pulmonary image analysis toolkit.
In an evaluation of 15 airway segmentation algorithms [@Lo:2012aa] for the
Extraction of Airways from CT challenge held in 2009, a total of 40 CT scans from 8 sites
divided into testing and training data sets and manually annotated by medical student
observers.  Sensitivity and specifity criteria were used to assess relative performance
levels with the top 2 performers were the algorithms of [@Feuerstein:2009aa] and [@Lee:2009aa]  with the latter
being one of the more conservative algorithms and the former being more prone to false positives.
Our plan is to provide an implementation of [@Feuerstein:2009aa] and then augment this
functionality with some of our previous work [@Song:2010aa] for
removing leakage path candidates.

ITK has extensive functionality for segmentation of vessel-like structures.  Much of that
work has been incorporated into comprehensive packages such as the
analysis and visualization Vessel Modeling ToolKit (http://www.vmtk.org).  For this
project we will focus development and refinement of these
ITK capabilities for CT lung application in segmenting the pulmonary vasculature.

ventilation defect.  The functional ventilation image is normalized to the corresponding
CT image.  The airways are segmented in the individual subject space.  After identification
of the ventilation defect of interest, we can automatically determine the bronchiole
pathway from the trachea to the defect.](Figs/airways.png)
-->

__Nodule detection.__ CT is used for screening of lung cancers (i.e., pulmonary nodules)
which currently requires human intervention for the laborious and tedius task of manual
scanning.  Automated detection methods could potentially save significant time and effort which
has inspired much research literature on the topic including several commercial systems
and specialized visualization hardware for facilitating detection.  In 2009, a nodule
detection competition was held for comparing performance of individual algorithms as well
as their combinations [@Ginneken:2010aa].  This competition included entries from both
academic institutions as well as a system from Philips (although, to our knowledge, none
are available for public use).  The best performing algorithm of that competition was
based on the work presented in [@Murphy:2009aa] where a k-nearest neighbor classification employing
local image features is built from a large training data set.  We plan to implement this
method potentially with some modifications based on our experience with a more recent
challenge dealing with segmentation of pathology [@Tustison:2014aa].

__3(c.2.2) Sub-Aim 1b will provide two annotated multi-atlas libraries, one for CT and one for 1H MRI.
The corresponding group templates will also be provided with the scripts to produce the results using
ITK-Lung.__  As a complement to the open-source software provided in Sub-Aim 1a, we will generate
atlas libraries for both CT and 1H MRI acquisitions.  Both libraries will consist of $n=30$ different
subjects and will be annotated according to modality.  The CT atlas library will include lung, lobe,
airway, and vessel segmentations.  The 1H MRI atlas library will include left/right lung segmentations.
With the annotated data we will provide the scripts and documentation to reproduce
the ITK-Lung results.  Additionally, two group templates [@Avants:2010aa] for the two atlas
libraries will be included as part of these open data sets.

__3(c.2.3) Sub-Aim 1c will extend current functionality of ITK-SNAP for qualitative
and quantitative assessment of the results produced by ITK-Lung.__
Project investigator Paul Yushkevich leads the development of ITK-SNAP [@Yushkevich:2006aa], a multi-platform
open-source tool for interactive user-guided medical image segmentation and data visualization. ITK-SNAP provides
an effective combination of semi-automatic segmentation functionality based on active
contours [@Caselles:1997aa;@Zhu:1996aa] and manual delineation functionality, put together into a compact and
easy-to-learn graphical user interface. ITK-SNAP supports segmentation of multiple
volumetric imaging modalities, species, and anatomical regions, without bias to any
particular problem domain. Compared to other, larger open-source image analysis tools,
ITK-SNAP design focuses specifically on the problem of image segmentation, and extraneous
or unrelated features are kept to a minimum. The design also emphasizes interaction and
ease of use, with the bulk of the development effort dedicated to the user interface.
ITK-SNAP has thousands of users (there have been over 2000 downloads per month in the
last year), and our 2006 paper on ITK-SNAP [@Yushkevich:2006aa] has been cited over 1400 times (Google
Scholar) in the context of various biomedical domains. In recent years, ITK-SNAP
development and maintenance were funded by grant 5R01 EB014346, and under this grant,
powerful new functionality for registration was developed. ITK-SNAP will be used in this project for manual labeling
of the proposed CT lung atlases; it is already used for this purpose by many investigators.
_Most crucially, we believe that our track record with ITK-SNAP as
well as ANTs demonstrates our team’s commitment to producing high-quality research
software and making it accessible to the wider research community through open-source
practices, intuitive user interfaces, and outreach efforts. These strengths of the team
will be applied to the software and data developed in the course of this project._

Several features will
be added to ITK-SNAP to enhance visualization and quantitation for the registration
and segmentation results of the lung-specific algorithms developed in the Sub-Aim 1a
and the data generated in Sub-Aim 1b.  Users will be able to edit and annotate these
segmentations, modify transforms, and extract quantities both globally and regionally.
Transforms will be modifiable via manual annotations (clicking corresponding landmarks and/or
tracing curves) or by directly modifying transform parameters.  Finally, quantitative parameters,
such as volumes and strain tensors, will be available through the ITK-SNAP interface.
_We believe that the proposed enhancements to the software will be extremely useful to the
general imaging research community and not just those investigators targeted in this project.
Thus, the impact of this work will be both immediate and broad for pulmonary-driven science
and research._


__3(c.2.4) Software engineering.__ Both ANTs and ITK-SNAP development, based on a solid foundation
provided by the Insight Toolkit, utilizes open-source
software engineering best practices, such as the use of Git version management software
for collaborative development and easy branching and merging; use of a centralized repository
(SourceForge) for code, executable and data sharing; use of the CMake/CTest/CDash suite for
cross-platform development, testing and automatic builds. Virtual machines with different
versions of Windows, MacOS and Linux operating systems generate nightly builds and execute
test code, uploading a binary to the central SourceForge repository. ANTs and ITK-SNAP are
documented through video and text tutorials, housed online on dedicated websites [@ANTsWebsite;@SnapWebsite].
A similar infrastructure will be developed for the software resources proposed in Aim 1.
